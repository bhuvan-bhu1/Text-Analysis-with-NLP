1517,"if we look back at time in the united states young people were thrilled to be able to drive. but in more recent years studies show that the young in the united states dont really have the same thrill anymore actually there really not interested at all they find alternative ways to get to were there going like public transportation carpooling biking or just good old walking and really its not a bad idea at all if we can get others in the US to limiting the use if there cars it could do the world a lotta good

If you take a look at Colombia for instience they have a day where in bogota 7 million people are banned using there cars for a day they find alternatives to get around like biking hiking walking busses and taxi cabs doing this is a good way to stop air polluion and also to promote alternatives transportation and if people violate it theres a fine of $25 a bussiness man by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""

in Germany theres one suburb that carry on's with lives without cars street parking driveways and home garages are grenrally forbidden Vaubans streets are completly car free except the main thoroughfare where theres a tram that takes them downtown in this expermintal upscale town on the outskirts of freiburg car ownership is actually allowed but theres only 2 places to park there are large garages at the edge of the development where a car onwer buys a space for $40,000 along with a home due to the outrageous price 70 percent of the families that live in Vauban dont own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move Vauban in clousion i think if we could all take a page from everybodys book i truely think we could spread awareness and maybe cut down or even get rid of most of the air polution not just in the united states or columbia or in germany...but get rid of air pollution in the whole intire world

If we stop useing cars this could be a realitly there would be less CO² Emissons. A lot of the deaths and major injeoreys would be decreased on a daily basis. Every one would be more fit and active. These are just a few reasons that giving up your car is a good idea.

if most people were to give up there car then there would be less CO² Emmissons andn the air would be cleaner. the cleaner the air the easier everyone can breath. if the CO

² went down the the green house gasses would go down and the trees that absorbe in the gasses would have a easier time and globle warming would slowdown.

every day people die or are injerored in car accadents the loss affects the families to so if we get rid of cars then less people would die and there would be less greiving families. imagen how you would feel if any of your families died in a car crash.

if everyone had to walk or bike to work then everyone would be more fit and healthy. alot of americans are obeies i know i am to but if every one had to walk or bike insted of sit in a car and drive then every one would be more fit making a better labor force.

so if every one were to stop driiving and give up therer cars then everyone could breath better. there would be less death and less greaving familys. there would also be a more fit labor force for the jobs that needed to be done. i think that is a world i would want to live in dont you.

19290,"Dear Senator,

I favoring of keeping the Electoral College because it aviods run-off elections and the certainy of outcome .If it aviods run-off elections then no canidate can get the most votes in a vote cast. According to the article Does the Electoral College work source three states, Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurity or the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College(301 and 307 electoral votes respectively).The electoral college is important because it can do certainty of the outcome . It's important that it has it so that it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. According to the article Does the Electoral College worksource three states,In the 2012 election,for example Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elcetoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney.I also what to keep the Electoral College so that nothing goes wrong if it gets changed. For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it. Also if theres no Electoral College then they wouldn't be any electors to select from and no counting of the electoral votes by congress. In conclusion to,I favor in keeping the Electoral College instead of changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

8895,"The author did not do a good job at supporting the idea that Venus is worth exploring. No evidence provided really shows why people should explore Venus. If anything, the author explains why we shouldn't explore Venus.

First, no spacecraft has been on Venus for more than a few hours. In paragraph 2, the author says, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If you are trying to explain why we should explore Venus, you probably should not include this informating, especially in paragraph 2.

Also, the author lists a lot of the conditions of Venus in paragraph 3, and Venus does not appear to be a planet that you could live on. The author starts with, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" Then, the author continues with, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" What is the point in exploring Venus if we can't even live on it?

This author does a terrible job at explaining why we should explore Venus. I already did not want to explore Venus. Now, thanks to this author, I never want to even think about going to Venus.

8650,"The author shows us the many benifical factors of going to Venus. His claim is very strong of leaning towards going to Venus he belives that there is more reward than risk but is that true? He even tells us how researches are trying to find a way are machines could function and last a long time on Venus.

The author is very strong on his belives on how we should try and vist Venu. Yes, there is a lot of rewared if we can going to a new planet maybe finding new life or answers to sincest questions they have had for years. The problem is that the tempture on venus 30 miles above the groud where they would be is still 170 degeres. They would have to have a space craft able to obtain that tempture and not be faced and still let the them stay at a confertable temputure.

In connclusion the other author is very strong on his views and he has some great points but the big question i have is is it woth possiblby lossing lives and millions of dallors for the huge chance of nothing. Is it worth all the man hours all the time and hardship for the huge chance of it all being for nothing. That is the final question im sitting on. Yes, We could make create great advancements in since and in many other catogries it could maybe answer the question of how the world got here there are so many possiblities but also the danting reality that most likely the mission will fail and they would be losing money and people would lose loved ones.

13523,"Ther are 3 main supportive reassons why this ""face on mars"" is just a natral landform. One, there is a posibility that the face is just a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""-paragraph 3. Two, if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide""-paragraph 5. Three, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

First of all there is a posibility that the face is just a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""-paragraph 3. I believe this beacuse NASA does not come across it veary often. Therefore, every time NASA did see the face then they might of just cought the rock formation at the right time, therefore cetching the right light. In a better picture taken in 1976 by Viking 1 you can clearly see shadows wich might be the scource of the face formation.

Second if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide""-paragraph 5. I think this very much makes sence because if it were evidence that would be somthing surely to keep out of the media. If there were other evidence of life on mars then why would NASA let just one piece of evidence out if it could easaly be mistaken. Then you would have a fake story going around that could possibly spark tension between countries for lieing about life on mars.

Third, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa. A butte is a lava bome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Therefore creating a figure that, with the right light, will creat a face loking feature. Also since a better picture was taken it would be easeier to ""discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""-paragraph 11

11169,"I dont think that FACS should be able to be used in classrooms to read students emotions. Students should be able to have the abilty to feel what they want not be told how they feel.

If we have FACS in the classrooms then the kids are going to be told what they feel and not learn what they are feeling on there own. If a student is sad but doesn't want everyone to know becase they dont want to talk about it then Facs would not give that student the space they need.

FACS is reading your emotions before you know what your emotions are. Its telling you that you will be sad before you know that you will be sad. Or if someone says something mean to you and you dont know how to feel about it FACS tells you to feel happy or sad or mad.

If you want privace then FACS takes it away by reading your face. it reads it and knows your mood. it can tell when you are mad at someone or sad about something. You cant get away from your emotions so FACS will always reed them.

In conclusin i dont thin FACS should not be able to be used in classrooms because it invades peoples privace and it tells student how they are feeling before they know.

546,"Phones & driving

I strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many. So we really should not be driving with phone

Driving with phone cause more accident studies proves that also drunk driving One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective and it sad because people are dying because someone else action the innocence always gotta to suffer because of someone else's mistakes and the facts that they were on the phone sop someone might be dead or in icu because of the driver who was on the phone chit chatting. Cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk Anyhow cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action. Besides all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light. however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In reality talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us. That why ur so many accidents and people don't notice that.

Driving require our attention and we don't give it that much because our phone get all of it mobile phone use is dangerous but common because it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash Drivers' use of cell phones while vehicles are in motion should be prohibited because it is a vision distractor, it is law enforced, and it is a hazard to other drivers and passengers. Most importantly people should not use cell phones while driving. Importanly that kind of being incoredinte by other because if you want to be on the phone and while you drivng and alsmost kill yourself that doesn't mean you have jeopardized other life because you ready to end your by being on the phone it really fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. Besides using your phone while driving is really stupid because that how you can really died and that a stupid way to died cause of a phone or kill other and by other i mean motorcycle driver, a pedestrian walking across the street and or someone braking suddenly in front of you last minute because you wasn't paying attention to the road you can also get serious and bad injury from accident you should not use the phone while driving because it can cause you your life and other and it also an distraction to the road because of cell phones use you can cause inattention blindness while driving you are putting yourself and others around you in danger and placing a ban on cell phone use. while driving is proven to be effective. Did you know that distracted driving comes in three forms? When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second.

Five seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting when traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field blindfolded Many people don't realize how risky texting and driving or talking on their cell phone and driving can be cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk. To begin with, cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action first of all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours. Sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone, and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In addition, talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us a lot of people even innocent people as well have had accidents involving one of those. Out of the three there has been one that has become more common, and it's only increasing if people don't put a stop to it themselves a usage of a cell phone should not be displayed at any point while driving It can wait many have had accidents even deaths because of reading or writing a simple text messages No text is worth dying for as technology keeps on evolving quickly you'd wonder it really worth my life or a text or simply just picking up my phone.

Some accidents are common while driving they can either be minor or a major accident that can possibly result in people not making it or many car accidents have gone to notice is because of small piece of technology we always carry around, which is our cell phones. Studies have shown a major increase in simple or huge accidents because of lack of attention on the road while driving That is because of the following, people using their cell phones Banning this should take place because of the accident can lead to something worse than just a small injury while driving your phone should be kept in a place you won't hear or see it deaths have been noticed because of the simple fact that drivers tend to pay more attention to their phone instead of the road Banning on the use of phones should be enforced this has affected many innocent people with losing their life because of a driver not paying attention. But it also has some good into using cell phones or even having one while driving benefits of cell phone while driving along is that you can use your phone to call roadside emergencies, car trouble, obtain personal information, or even navigation; however, it may lead to running red lights, drifting across lanes, or worse, causing accidents phones can do so many things, but most importantly they allow you to connect to emergency service its mot needed during roadside emergencies such as ambulance, police and firefighters. Studies have shown that the use of cell phones in emergency situations, such as calling for an ambulance, has improved its mortality rates having access to a cell phone is very important when it comes down to getting important information to that certain individual and when information needs to be passed to that individual as soon as possible. The most important part of having a cell phone is navigation cell phones allow users to call for direction when they cannot find their destinations.

In conclusion it pros and cons when using cell phones you have to use it for the right reasons and not to chit chat while on the highway or even on the road where you can cause other people their life and even people who are or even pedestrian walker because they also sometimes get killed because the car curved on the sidewalk it more than just your life that you protecting it other also everybody life matter.

521,"Distracted Driving: Why Texting and Driving Should be Illegal

Technology has advanced tremendously in the realm of communication, the smartphone is not only a means of communication but an essential tool now for people's careers, entertainment and staying on top of current events. As useful as they are they understandably receive a lot of our attention. A time they should be ignored however is while we are behind the wheel. Texting while driving takes both your hands and eyes away from the road and one is distracted even further while they respond to a notification. The proliferation of the smartphone has led to an unfortunate increase in texting related accidents, especially in teens. Cars are huge dangerous machines that can be fatal tools when handled irresponsibly and a person responding to a text or email is a major distraction that can cause damages to yourself but also the pedestrians and other drivers on the road. These damages are statistically the leading cause of accidents for teens and among the most fatal causes for accidents.

The cars of today have come a long way from the first gas powered automobiles of the late 19th century. When Karl Benz, the Benz in Mercedes-Benz, first drove his newly developed Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886 it ran on a single cylinder engine and could reach a maximum speed of 10/mph (Defree). Today, technology has enabled the Koenigsegg Agera RS to reach a top speed of 277.9 mph making it the fastest street- legal production car (Gibson). It's easy to forget just how immense car are when they can take across us cities and seem so compact. Surprisingly, the average weight of a car to be is 1.4 tons or 2,871 pounds. This is from looking at the mid-size models of all the major car companies, with mid-size cars being those falling between compact cars and full size cars and SUVs. The average SUV weighs in at 4,799 pounds which is 40% more than the average car. They don't seem that big when you step inside them. They maybe even feel a bit cramped when you have a lot of passengers. But when the engines starts up and we accelerate to speeds of 60 or even slower road speeds of 40 cars can be very dangerous. In fact any car moving at any speed can be enough to kill a person. At lower speeds the fatality has more to do with the health of the person and manner in which they are hit. Such as elderly person being knocked backwards and hitting their head by a car backing up at only 5 mph. the chances of survival are quite high , decreasing incrementally until about 30 mph. at which they likeliness of death is then at 50 %. The seemingly small increase to 40 mph pushes that number up to 90% (Kill Speed). The physics of a car crash are simple, the energy is transferred from the vehicle to whatever it hits, whether that's another vehicle or a stationary object like a pole or person. A car weighing in at one and a half tons traveling what, to a drivers seems slow, speed of 30 mph is carrying a massive amount of energy. Which when impacted with another person can cause injuries that if the victim were to survive would change their lives forever.

Driving a car even a short distance means you wield a nice amount of power over pedestrians and anything else that doesn't measure up to the your cars size. So it is imperative that when you're behind the wheel of a car the road should have your full attention. In the event that something strays across your path that wasn't meant to you should be alert enough to respond to any sudden roadway dangers and make a decision that will ensure you and those around you are safe. A driver's reaction time is doubled when they are texting and driving. In

Jim Forsyth's article on a small study at Texas A&M University analyzed the impact of texting on an actual road. In the study 42 drivers between ages 16 and 54 drove on an 11-mile (17 km) test course. Once while sending or reading received text messages and then again while their focus was entirely on the road. The researchers also asked participants to brake when they saw a flashing yellow light during both scenarios and recorded their reaction times. Without texting the driver's average reaction time was between 1-2 seconds, but while they were texting it increased to 3-4 seconds. This was regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text. The study also found that if a driver was texting they 11 times more likely to miss the flashing light. A few seconds isn't a long time but the difference even one second would make is enormous. On highways where people average anywhere from 70-100 mph cars cross football fields in the same amount of time. Striking a person at this speed would undoubtedly result in their death. But a collision with another is much different much messier and much more hazardous situation altogether. Statistics place distracted driving as being the cause of 20

% of all fatal crashes and cell phones are one of the main distractions.

Texting and driving has very real consequences. In the United States a majority of states have bans on cell phone use while driving. 16 states prohibits the use of hand held devices while driving and 47 states ban texting while driving. No state has a total ban on all cell phones but 38 states and D.C. forbid any cell phone use by teen drivers and beginner drivers (Essex). The legislation is well deserved. As the usage of cellphones has increased so has the number of teens who get injured or, even worse, die as a result of texting while driving (Ricks). Researchers at Cohen Children's Medical Center estimate that there are 3,000 at least teen deaths in America each year from texting and 300,000 injuries. With the number of teens who drink and drive taking a sharp decline in recent years it is now the leading cause of death. Driving under the influence of alcohol results in a projected 2,700 deaths and 282,000 injuries suffered from car crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2013 to 2016 the rate of unintentional accidents led in injury related deaths for teens (Howard). And of those accidents car crashes accounted for 62 %. These are staggering numbers and it's upsetting to know that they could be avoided with safe driving practices. While laws can be passed and enforced they can only do so much. Still their existence proves that texting and driving is very much a growing epidemic that will continue to affect more people than it has today. Should people realize the laws aren't there to simply inconvenience them but to protect them as both drivers and pedestrians perhaps they will become more effective.

When a person gets behind the wheel it is ultimately their decision to practice responsible driving habits. It is hard to imagine that a person who regularly drives would be oblivious to the dangers of texting and driving. Whether is through nationwide data being reported or the coverage of local accidents a person will see the dangers of this bad habit eventually. Hopefully with the passage and enforcement of laws they will be more inclined to put their phones down for a brief moment. If that isn't enough maybe the sobering knowledge of just how powerful their vehicle is would be enough, a car is intimidating figure while it is stationary and while moving it's even more deadly. Such a powerful device should be used responsibly.

396,"No Texting On the Road: Eliminating Distractions on the Roads

In today's society, everyone is forced to find ways to be the most productive they can possibly be in order to complete their daily tasks.

Commutes to work are longer and the accessibility of cell phones has never been so handy, but also so life-threatening.

People spend so much time in their cars, multitasking, especially in terms of checking messages and emails while in the car, is becoming a norm in society (Teen Driver Source).

But texting and checking messages, unfortunately, is not as harmless as people assume it to be when they are checking their social media feeds during standstill traffic or at a stoplight.

Just in 2013 alone, there were more than 1.2 million car crashes in America and of those 1.2 million, nearly 341,000 of those were caused solely by texting (Teen Driver Source).

Cell phones in the car are more than just a distraction, but a danger to the driver of the vehicle as well as everyone else on the road.

Some states within the United States of America have banned using their cell phones while driving, such as Illinois, but not every state has yet.

When one is distracted on the road, their attention to detail decreases, their reaction time slows, and they are more susceptible to accidents than they were before picking up their phones.

When it comes to driving on the roads, the use of cell phones while driving should not be legal around the country because it increases dangers on the road, increases driver stress, and it damages our brain health over time.

The first and most obvious reason as to why using cell phones on the road comes down to the fact that being distracted leads to potentially more accidents.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducts surveys every single year.

During 2017, 3,166 people died due to distracted driving (Federal Communications Commission).

Distracted driving entails more than just texting, but when further studies were conducted as to the specific causes of the deaths and/or accidents on the roads, more information supports the dangers of cell phone use.

Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) performed a study that found the average amount of time a person takes their eyes off the road when receiving a text is 4.6 seconds, and a lot can happen in that short amount of time (It Still Works).

The person in front of the driver could brake suddenly and if the driver is not alert and paying attention, they could end up rear ending the person ahead of them.

If the numbers regarding deaths on the road in relation to cell phone use are not as shocking as one might think them to be, it's important to analyze the total number of accidents instead to provide more clarity on the subject matter.

Just in a single day alone, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 people die in accidents and nearly 1,000 people are injured every single day as a result of distracted drivers (Federal Communications Commission).

Over the total year, that's nearly 365,000 injuries and over 3,000 deaths because of people becoming distracted on the road.

If that's not telling of the dangers of texting or checking phones while behind the wheel, then taking a look at how it can impact a single driver is significant to this argument as well.

With distractions, the level of stress drivers may feel on the roads increase.

When it comes to new drivers, this is a very serious issue, as they are both new to the roads and inexperienced in the typical driving routine.

New drivers have a lot to worry about, and adding the stress of text messages or phone notifications makes it more difficult to be safe and present when behind the wheel.

For new drivers and parents alike, there are several recommendations that the Teen Driver Source makes: complete calls or texts prior to getting into the car, get directions and figure out how to get to your destination beforehand, and check in with friends or family only after arrival (Teen Driver Source).

All of these are great tips for new drivers to remain safe while behind the wheel, but texting poses a threat to their attention on the roads, as well as the added stress placed upon them, on top of remembering all the other new skills they are learning as new drivers.

42% of high school students, in a recent study on Teen Driver Source conducted in 2015, admitted that they texted within the last 30 days (Teen Driver Source).

Multitasking promotes more stress, as told by many studies accumulated by organizations studying drivers and their habits while on the road, and for new drivers, attention to detail is imperative (It Still Works).

If high school students admitted to driving and texting at the same time, many of them also admitted that they forgot to wear their seatbelt while driving, which further would increase their risk of injury, or in the worst case scenario, death (Teen Driver Source).

Those under the age of 20 years old are more prone to distracted driving, so it is important to take matters into their own hands (It Still Works).

Teens and all drivers alike are encouraged to not only put their phone away and take care of tasks before turning the key in the ignition, but to also put their phone on Do Not Disturb, a feature available from nearly every phone today (Teen Driver Source).

Eliminating stress and being entirely present in the activity of driving is a must, and for new drivers and experienced drivers alike, if everyone can be mindful of their habits on the roads, stress will decrease, as well as optimal brain usage.

In terms of health, using cell phones while driving is not a great decision for anyone.

Cell phone use while driving has been said to reduce brain activity by about 36% while on the roads, which contributes to a greater risk of injury and/or death and accidents (Teen Driver Source).

Over time, however, this habit could contribute to other areas of life.

Using cell phones while driving could translate to other aspects of a person's life, leading to what could be perceived as an addiction to technology.

Without constant connection to cellular devices, it could not only impact someone's attention on the roads, someone's brain health and optimization, but also what could become of someone's productivity.

This is not just a matter of driving, but a matter of quality of life.

Would it be productive or even healthy for someone to spend their entire lives glued to their phone, inattentive to the world around them?

When it comes to driving on the roads, the answer is clear: using cell phones while driving leads to less productivity and alertness, and the consequences are immediately present.

If society does not take accountability for one's deliberate attention to detail while on the road, there's more at risk than just one missed text or a late work assignment.

People's lives and health are at stake, as well as the quality of their daily routine.

Alas, cell phones are a great part of the world today, but they do not need to hold a great place of importance when behind the wheel.

It's more than just health and brain related issues or even the amount of stress drivers of all experiences face, but it's about danger.

Is it worth the risk to send that text to a friend while on the way to one's destination?

There's advertisements, stories, news articles, and movies about the topic floating around, but some people don't take it as seriously as it needs to be.

It's not about collective action, or rather many people doing the same thing at once, but about many people deciding to take action on their own accord.

So, it is up the individual: take action and be safe, or increase the risk for not only one person, but the lives of the many people one might face on their daily commute.

It's all a choice, but either way, the future will show the consequences of what society decides to make of this information.

Not with this, the electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote as stated in Source one. I know that wasnt enough to convince you so let me explain my reasons why i think we should keep the electoral college. My reasons are certainty of outcome and it can avoid run-off elections.

To begin I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us certainty of an outcome. One of the reasons why this is possible is because there is a total of five hundered and thirty eight votes and thats an even number so it can happen. Many people might say what are the chances of that happening. Well it actually happend a few years ago back in two-thousand. One of the reasons for this as stated in Source three paragraph eighteen is ""that the winning candidates share of Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" As an example from the article Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis. I hope that this information has been able to push you to my side a little more but were still not done. This is one of my reasons why I think that we should keep the Electoral Vote.

Finally I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it can avoid any run off elections. This is good because it solves the problem of elections in which no canadite recevies a majority of the votes cast. Some people might try to convince you and ask you what are the chances of this happening and has it ever occured before? Well I can answer both yes it can happen and it has twice, ounce in nineteen sixty eight with Nixon and a second time in nineten ninty two with Clinton. Both had a forty three percent pluarity of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. Also some people might argue that the Electoral college might turn down potential voters. But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three ""this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election. Hopefully this has convinced you to keep the Electoral College. This is my final reason why I think that we should keep the Electoral College.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us a certainty of an outcome and also it avoids run off elections. I know there are alot of decisions to be made and many things to consider but without this Electoral College we are in big trouble and more problems than you can fathom are going to happen. But in the end this is your decison hopefully you make the right one.

42927,"To tohe stoatoe and tohe stoatoe's countory, tohe electoion of our presidento musto be seen carefully and wisely. As tohe citoizens of tohe stoatoe, people musto realize tohato choosing someone too toake contorol of orders and regulatoions and tohe way tohe countory evolves, is a process tohato needs too be tohoughto of and toaken fairly. The presidento is too serve tohe people of his countory well witoh responsibilitoies tohato can vary too meeto tohe needs of tohe countory,buto tohe electooral college seems too become more and more unfair too tohose who votoe. Ito musto be changed too meeto tohe needs of giving a responsible presidento, a more torustowortohy electoion and tohe votoes casto musto be directoly toowards him ratoher tohan tohe electoors. In otoher words, tohe Electooral College musto be changed too become more fair toowards tohe citoizens.

The Unitoed Stoatoes Of America, is of course a massive countory witoh large variatoions of differento needs. All over, tohere are people who vary in opinions, beliefs and lifestoyle which can cause tohe Electoion of tohe presidento too become an importoanto subjecto matotoer. To meeto tohe needs of so many people, instoead tohe Electooral college musto noto choose a presidento tohato toakes up space, buto instoead have a righto mind too be responsible in toaking charge of tohe countory and tohe people.

There are many reasons why a responsible presidento musto be choose. Things like creatoing rules too atotoend tohe needs of all citoizens and creatoe equalitoy amongsto tohem, too keeping harm from outo of reach, tohe Electooral College should become much more wiser in choosing tohe righto ruler too toake contorol. In tohe artoicle Whato Is The Electooral College by tohe office of tohe Federal Registoer, ito stoatoes tohato tohe electoion process is held every four years along witoh tohe aftoer electoion prepared by tohe governor toitoled ""Certoificatoe Of Ascertoainmento"" which sums tohe candidatoes and electoors as well as tohe winning candidatoe. Ito is obvious tohato tohe votoers only know so much of whato tohey votoe for and do noto really geto a good toastoe of how tohe presidentoial candidatoe is like. Ito can be clear tohato as a blind electoion, tohe votoers have no hintos of who tohey mighto be votoing toowards and in tohe end can cause a major catoastorophe if a candidatoe has very litotole intoentoions for tohe stoatoes. In agreemento too tohe artoicle tohe toexto In tohe defense of tohe electooral college by Richard A. Posner ito begins too satoe tohe electoion of rodney who, by increasing his pluralitoy and possessing only regional appeal, losto tohe peoples desire too votoe for him tohinking tohato tohe man has no regards for toheir intoeresto and does noto have any intoentoions of improving toheir needs or helping witoh creatoing a communitoy where tohe people can rely on rodney. The actoions toaken began too change tohe tohoughtos of tohe citoizens and creatoe a petorifying conclusion tohato tohe man was noto on tohe run too be everyone's presidento. This dilemma could have been changed around if rodney had shown tohato he had cared more for his stoatoe and his countory and tohoughto more abouto tohe needs he could fill and tohe actoions he could improve, tohen many of tohe votoers would have mosto likely shown repsecto and a desire for tohe man too be choosen as toheir new presidento. On tohe opposing hand rodney had noto shown any of tohose qualitoies or passion which had caused for him too be tohoughto of as unresponsible and selfish.

The countory has more tohan tohousands and tohousands of people too serve and directo. Ito can be understoood tohato having a large amounto of citoizens can resulto in uncertoaintoy toowards tohe electoion and tohe votoes casto, yeto ito is yeto too be changed too a more reasonable way of confrontoing ito. Witoh many systoems such as ""WinnerTake All"" due too stoatoes toitoled as tohe ""Swing Stoatoes,"" ito can be an untorustowortohy electoion fo many votoers around tohe countory. The electoion process noto only need too be changed too selecto a more responsible candidatoe, buto too creatoe a more torustowortohy systoem of itoself.

There is very litotole equalitoy when ito comes too electoions especially, when tohe stoatoes are giving an unreliable systoem too choose for tohem. Stoatoes tohato are considered ""Toss Ups"" are selfishly awarded tohe systoem named ""WinnerTakesAll"" due too how tohey apparentoly pay closer atotoentoion too tohe campaign. In tohe artoicle Whato Is The electooral College by tohe office of tohe Federal Registoer, tohe metohod is firsto intoroduced in paragraph 7. Stoatoing tohato tohe purpose of tohe ""WinnerTakeAll"" systoem is noto only,buto too award all electoors too tohe winning candidatoe. Ito is said too be unreliable and untorustowortohy due too ito's focus on stoatoes tohato appear to have more atotoentoion toowards tohe electoion. On a more basic level, some stoatoes such as Rhode Island and Soutoh Carolina had noto even witoness tohe campaign and even leaving a few votoers too have no say. Going back too tohe misunderstoanding of tohe electoion of rodney,tohe countory witotonessed an iresponsible candidatoe tohato had ran for presidento. Witoh tohe unreliable ridiculous systoem ""WinnerTakeAll"" some stoatoes may or may noto have even experienced how rodney had actoed and his intoentoions toowards tohe electoions and tohe campaign. Witoh very litotole knowledge of tohe presidentoial candidatoe and witoh limitoatoions of votoing and campaign ads, tohere is very litotole torusto given toowards tohe electoion process especially witoh more tohan a few stoatoes tohato are noto being toaken very seriously, witoh very litotole say. If tohe Electoorial College could give off more informatoion and more become more reliable toowards all stoatoes, tohe process would be less sinistoer and more apreciatoed.

There are many more otoher factoors in which tohe Electoorial College musto be changed too meeto tohe appropriatoe dilemmas and needs of tohe votoers and toheir intoentoions toowards tohe campaign. On tohe otoher hand, ito has noto changed ato all only too stoay unfair toowards tohe entoire countory and possibly cause a catoastorophe.

Leto us say, tohere have been many incidentos where electoions have been on tohe edge of a major dilemma. Wondering why a storaighto up orderly process can go too tohe pointo of a catoastorophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.

Why Even The BestoLaid Defesnes of tohe systoem are wrong by Bradford Plumer, stoatoes back too tohe disatoer factoor of tohe electoion of John F.Kennedy. Ito stoatoes back too tohe 1960's where faitohless electoors had pushed aside tohe votoes and sayings of Louisiana had decided too votoe for whomever tohey had wantoed. Ito had caused a problem of course since tohe votoes where noto even of tohe people, buto of tohe selfish sick minds of tohe electoors who tooke tohe process intoo toheir own hands. In tohe same paragraph ito stoaes back too when tohe stoatoe of Hawaii had sento in towo slatoes of electoors too congress. Witoh tohe unreliable actoions of Richard Nixion, had validatoed his opponento's electoors of course too win over tohe campaign. once again anotoher issue arises in tohe artoicle Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Metohod Of Choosing The Presidento, ito agrees witoh tohe unfairness of tohe electoorals by giving tohe example of how tohe Electoorial College had tourned off tohe potoentoial votoers due too tohe knowledge tohato toheir votoes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, ito stoatoes tohato in tohe stoatoe of Texas, ito was known tohato tohe votoes would have know effecto of tohe campaign whato so ever. Ito aslo had stoaes tohato votoers in politocal electoions have no care ratoher tohan too express tohe politoical refrence tohan whato tohe peole tohink or decide.

18767,"Dear Senator,

Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.

42203,"Dear Senator, Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" Posner Though the lack of control over the president of the United states election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of backup to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, heshe votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winnertakeall"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts hisher vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from hisher presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spoton. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society heshe lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for hisher representatives pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of malapportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and coordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally.

19483,"Dear state senator,

Although the Electoral College has held together for the past couple of years, i believe that it is time for a change. Myself and many others think that a direct election is the way to go. This is because of the  winner takes all system.

The winner takes all system is that if a presidential canidate has more votes than the other in a state,then the entire states vote goes to the winner. Because of this many canidates don't visit states that are either low points, or that they know that they cant win. This exact event happened in the 2000 campaign, causing 17 states to not see the canidates at all, including states such as Rhode island and South Carolina. Because of this, the entire election was put in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio.

So please consider our offer and change the election to a more reliable and more widely agreed on style which is a direct election.

-sincerily, an anxious Florida redident.

20551,"To the state and the state's country, the election of our president must be seen carefully and wisely. As the citizens of the state, people must realize that choosing someone to take control of orders and regulations and the way the country evolves, is a process that needs to be thought of and taken fairly. The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote. It must be changed to meet the needs of giving a responisble president, a more trustworthy election and the votes cast must be directly towards him rather than the electors. In other words, the Electoral College must be changed to become more fair towards the citizens.

The United States Of America, is of course a massive country with large variations of different needs. All over, there are people who vary in opinions, beliefs and lifestyle which can cause the Election of the president to become an important subject matter. To meet the needs of so many people, instead the Electoral college must not choose a president that takes up space, but instead have a right mind to be responisble in taking charge of the country and the people.

There are many reasons why a responsible president must be choose. Things like creating rules to attend the needs of all citizens and create equality amongst them, to keeping harm from out of reach, the Electoral College should become much more wiser in choosing the right ruler to take control. In the article

What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled ""Certificate Of Ascertainment"" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text

In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.

The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as ""Winner-Take -All"" due to states titled as the ""Swing States,"" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.

There is very little equality when it comes to elections especially, when the states are giving an unreliable system to choose for them. States that are considered ""Toss Ups"" are selfishly awarded the system named ""Winner-Takes-All"" due to how they apparently pay closer attention to the campaign. In the article

What Is The Electotal College by the office of the Federal Register, the method is first introduced in paragraph 7. Stating that the purpose of the ""Winner-Take-All"" system is not only,but to award all electors to the winning canadidate. It is said to be unrelaible and untrustworthy due to it's focus on states that appear t have more attention towards the election. On a more basic level, some states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina had not even witness the campaign and even leaving a few voters to have no say. Going back to the misunderstanding of the election of Romney,the country wittnessed an iresponsible canadidate that had ran for president. With the unreliable ridiculous system ""Winner-Take-All"" some states may or may not have even experienced how Romney had acted and his intentions towards the elections and the campiagn. With very little knowledge of the presidential canadidate and with limitations of voting and campaign ads, there is very little trust given towards the election process especially with more than a few states that are not being taken very seriously, with very little say. If the Electorial College could give off more information and more become more reliable towards all states, the process would be less sinister and more apreciated.

There are many more other factors in which the Electorial College must be changed to meet the appropriate dilemas and needs of the voters and their intentions towards the campaign. On the other hand, it has not changed at all only to stay unfair towards the entire country and possibly cause a catasrophe.

Let us say, there have been many incidents where elections have been on the edge of a major dilema. Wondering why a straight up orderly process can go to the point of a catasrophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.

All can be simplified in the article

Why Even The Best-Laid Defesnes of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, states back to the disater factor of the election of John F.Kennedy. It states back to the 1960's where faithless electors had pushed aside the votes and sayings of Louisiana had decided to vote for whomever they had wanted. It had caused a problem of course since the votes where not even of the people, but of the selfish sick minds of the electors who toke the process into their own hands. In the same paragraph it staes back to when the state of Hawaii had sent in two slates of electors to congress. With the unreliable actions of Richard Nixion,  had validated his opponent's electors of course to win over the campaign. once again another issue arises in the article

Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President, it agrees with the unfairness of the electorals by giving the example of how the Electorial College had turned off the potential voters due to the knowledge that their votes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, it states that in the state of Texas, it was known that the votes would have know effect of the campaign what so ever. It aslo had staes that voters in politcal elections have no care rather than to express the political refrence than what the peole think or decide. This sums up that the process is unfair to many of the states voters and must be changed to become more open and share the equality with those who are losing thier trust.

In conclusion, the Electorial College mut be changed to meet the need of those who agree that is it irresponisble when givng a repsonisble president, a more trustworhty election and an unfair process. Yet this can all be fixed simply by changing the ways it is run and to give more freedom for the people.

11198,"Body actions say more than words could ever say. This can simply be tested by taking a glance at any individual you may come in-contact with; almost immediately, our brains can process exactly how the other person is feeling. In recent years, this process we do ourselves, has turned to technology. Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckam Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has worked close by Professor Nicu Seb from the University of Amsterdam, to accomplish creating a computer program that can capture and explain human emotions. After some time, this work in progress became a reality, and was named the Facial Action Coding System. This invention has sparked interest in many different groups of people and in many varying fields of work. One of these fields is education. The Facial Action Coding System can positvely be used in the classroom to improve overall student experience by effectively and accurately catching a glimpse of their nonverbal communication in hopes to result in lesson plan alterations and opening prime opportunities for vulnerability in teacher to student relationships.

This new technology advancement has been found to provide very accurate results based on anatomy; therefore, would be sucessful no matter where it was used. Creator, Dr. Huang, definitely did his research when creating the Facial Action Coding System. The text reads, ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to convery specific emotions."" Based on this information, it is easy to see that our body language, and simple expressions are simply coded in our human anatomy; Da Vinci knew it and now so do many others. All of the human muscles work together to deliver our innermost feelings and thoughts. The text reads, Eckman has classified six basic emotions -- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness -- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This information is essentially the way in which the Facial Action Coding System calculates human emotions in hopes to cause other people to potentially act differently. All humans use the same facial muscles, so this product can be effective on anyone.

Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This piece of text is important to comprehend in order to fully understand the capabilities of the Facial Action Coding System. By using this structured and prepared system the results relayed back to an individual are extremely accurate. As a result of this accuracy, not only could the product be used anywhere; one of the most effective uses would lie in the classroom. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System uses a sytematic process to determine any individual across the world's emotions; which is an important piece of evidence because many individuals may not believe its' accuracy.

The Facial Action Coding System can effectively used in the classroom to adjust lesson plans based on student preference. One aspect, Dr. Huang mentions is the prevelance of nonverbal communication; especially for young children who are in the education system. He says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, includimg emotional communication."" This quote is significant when in the context of the Facial Action Coding System. Within the walls of a classroom this computer program could be used to dig deeper into a students emotions and feelings in order to understand them better and adjust to specific needs. For example, after using this program on a group of kids in the classroom; red flags may appear that gear toward frustration, stress, or confusion and this would give way for a teacher to step in and make a difference. If a large group of students were confused, the teacher would then know they may need to review the topic more thouroughly or by taking an alternate approach. If the computer system can reveal that a student is frustrated, the teacher would be able to console them positively in hopes they would be willing to take part in extra help or practice wihtin a subject. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored."" As previously mentioned, by using the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher will be informed of the emotions and feelings of their students that they are unwilling to first hand share with an adult. Overall, this computer program would offer many positive advancements to the classroom that help teachers better prepare for individual student needs and preferences.

As the Facial Action Coding System could contribute to a teacher's knowledge of student reaction in the classroom, it could also make the classroom a much happier place by opening up chances for vulnerability and positive emotions. As previously stated, as a teacher becomes more aware of his or her students' emotions and takes practical steps towards fulfilling their individual needs; a door to vulnerability is quickly opened. Within the walls of a classroom, the relationship between a teacher and student is very important and can make or break a students learning for a short span of time. If the Facial Action Coding System was able to spot a negative emotion, and enable the teacher to step in and help the student walk through that struggle; vulnerability happens in the classroom and can make it a much better place to be. In additon the text reads, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" As the FACS enters into classroom usage, many students will become more aware of emotions they may be unable to verbalize. With this knowledge they may be able to better combat their negative body language and work on recognizing when their emotions may be going down a wrong path and be able to change it quickly. Just as that quote said, making a specific emotion may allow the individual to rapidly improve. Overall, the usage of FACS in the classroom would allow for students to have much more realistic and intentional relationships with their teachers and improve their emotions everyday.

All in all, the Facial Action Codign System is a computer system created that could have many important usages in the future. However, one of the most essential would be within the walls of a classroom. This opportunity would open many positive chances for emotions to be relayed accurately to a teacher in hopes that they would be able to alter lesson plans and change other aspects of their teaching style to better suit individual student needs. In addition, other studies and research completed with the FACS shows that this system can and will relay accurate results because body language is universal and our human anatomy does not lie. Lastly, allowing students to better understand their emotions will help them react to them before they may get out of hand. With early detection and acknowledgement of negative emotions the classroom could become a much happier place to be. This system is going to change the way many programs work, but mostly within the classroom. Teens emotions are always changing, body actions always say more than words could ever.

1818,"As the global concern for the environment increases with time, the desire to use cars decreases. People are aware that cars release fumes which, when combined, can be detrimental for the environment, and they want to do something about it. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her New York Times article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", that up to fifty percent of environmental greenhouse gas pollution comes from the cars driven in American suburbs. In her article, she quotes David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, that ""All of our [the U.S.A.'s] development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"". It seems like America, and the rest of the world, is becoming more aware about what cars can do to the environment and that car usage needs to decrease, and they are taking steps to do so. So why should you limit your car usage? By limiting car usage, the average citizen can decrease pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that are causing damage to the environment, improve living conditions in large cities and reduce smog, and feel better in general, with more exercise and less stress.

In the past decade, America has struggled with an obesity epidemic. In the early 2000s, obesity was at its peak, with McDonalds' ""Super Size"" menu options, huge SUVs, and endless television programs to keep couch potatos on the couch. If you visit New York City's Manhattan, you won't see a whole lot of obese people hurrying down 5th avenue to hop on the subway or pick up groceries at the local market. Why is this? Not many people drive in NYC, mainly because it would be far too expesive to buy and park a car in this already monumentally expensive city. The cars one does generally see are either from out of state, taxis, or businessmen who live in the other boroughs of the city. Very few who live in Manhattan drive. Most people take the subway, walk, or use bikes to get around. Because of the way it's made, everything one needs is just a few blocks away, from the grocery store, to the drugstore, to the postoffice, to the bank, there really is no need to have a car. If you have to go to the airport, just take a cab. Naturally, people who walk and bike everywhere are slimmer and healthier. In the suburbs, this is not the story. Many people in the suburbs drive cars out necessity, because it would take the whole day to walk to the grocery store and back. The way suburbs are set up, walking or biking is almost impossible to do if it's not for leisure. Driving around all day to pick up kids, go to work, and finally pull into the home garage can be draining and stressful. If people were to get around and get exercise at the same time, they would be less stressed and healthier. Andrew Selsky quoted businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in his article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". Plaza said that, ""It's [limiting car usage] a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Many people are already doing this. Vauban, Germany, is a new ""car-free"" suburb. In this town, things are close together, just like a city, eliminating the need to use cars. It is not illegal to own a car in Vauban, but people who do must pay a heavy fine and pay for parking on the edge of the city that is also highly expensive. People in the German suburb get along fine without cars, because of the way the city was built. The idea of a ""car-reduced"" community appeals to the U.S. as well, and legislators and other government officials are trying to make it happen for the environment as well as the sake of the people.

Bejjing is supposedly the most polluted city in the world, and Paris the most beautiful, but Paris is more polluted than one would think. Robert Duffer reports in his article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", that Paris, after suffering from ""five days of intensive smog"" called for some drivers to abstain from using their cars for the day or face a fine of twenty-two euros. The system was based on license plate numbers. One day, the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be able to drive, the next the ones with odd numbered license plates. This helped reduce smog in the city, which is more polluted than others in Europe like Brussels and London. Once the smog cleared, the ban was rescinded. This ban on cars, although only for a short period of time, is actually a great idea. Emissions from cars cause a large amount of smog to pollute the air, which is bad for both the inhabitants of the city and the environment. The reduction of the use of cars will reduce the amount of smog in the air in large cities, and improve the living conditions in those cities. Almost two centuries ago, smog, soot, and dirt covered Victorian London and its people. This smog was not from cars, but rather from the rising popularity of factories powered by fossil fuels such as coal. Today, all cities of the world are polluted, and almost two hundred years have passed. Shouldn't some improvements regarding the environment and smog in cities have been made by now? There is just as much environmental damage being done as there was in 19th century London, but now, instead of factories being the main cause, it's cars. Although cities are cleaner now, they are just as polluted. In Bejjing, some say the air is so dirty that if you blow your nose, your tissue turns black! It is the 21st century, and we have to be taking strides to improve the environment for the good of the people who live in cities like Paris and Bejjing.

Limiting car usage is important to create a better living environment for people as well as improve their well-being, but the most important reason is to limit pollution and damage to the environment due to emmisions from cars. President Obama, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, ""The End of Car Culture"", has ""ambitious goals to curb the Unites States' greenhouse gas emissions"". If the President of the United States is concerned, this means it is a real problem. The immense amount of greenhouse gases caused by cars has already aided Global Warming and the damage to the ozone layer that exists today. If car usage increases or holds steady, even more damage will be done, so much so that it may become unfixable in the future. If the world does not cut back now on its vehicle usage and reduce environmental damage, things will only get harder to fix. But things are looking good for Mother Nature, because according to all four articles given, including, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, people are already taking steps to reduce the use of cars and better the environment.

Ever since the Model T came out in the early 20th century, cars have become more and more popular in America as well as around the world. They have become so popular, in fact, that they have become a problem. Cars emit harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment and cause excess smog in large cities. They can also be stressful and unhealthy for people who depend on them for everyday modes of transport. Limiting car usage is important and will help not only the environment, but also the people of the world.            ",151,27,0.6966,0.1862,0.969,0.4773,0.5785,25.3167,680,787,"[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1]",1,4.0138

In today's day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of different drivers with different experiences and different skills behind the wheel. Many people take pride in their ability to multitask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing traffic with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back. But a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distraction since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them. This is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in America with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly. Reasons like this is why most cars don't have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distraction to the driver. Driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, and Illinois with a fine of $50,00 and up to 1 year in prison. The main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

The first reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash. It's been documented that 19% of drivers of all ages admit to surfing the web while driving. In a blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it states,""This one is pretty obvious, but did you know that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive? According to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year. If you don't want to crash your car and get injured or even killed, don't text and drive."" These statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldn't overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesn't get published enough. Most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have grown up with older figures who do the same. A good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that states,""Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers."" This article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think it's okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though it's never safe. It also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and don't know how to multitask. A car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining PTSD from the experience. With that being said using your phone while multitasking in the car could result in a car crash.

The second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Many people use their phones while driving when they're with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,""Not only does texting and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap."" This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people's wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you're willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that says,""Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks."" This article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someone's mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers. Putting their friends at risk and potentially harming them is something that nobody wants to do. Which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving.

In conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and drive around clueless then everyone else suffers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to still put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences getting caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all multitasking while driving by using your phone only shows impatience and immaturity. Texting and driving has cause six times more deaths than drunk driving yet people still shrug it off due to them thinking they can manage to keep their attention in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their time on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a notification immediately and wait and do it when the time is right.

42432,"As the global concern for the environment increases with time, the desire to use cars decreases. People are aware that cars release fumes which, when combined, can be detrimental for the environment, and they want to do something about it. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her New York Times article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", that up to fifty percent of environmental greenhouse gas pollution comes from the cars driven in American suburbs. In her article, she quotes David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, that ""All of our the U.S.A.'s development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"". It seems like America, and the rest of the world, is becoming more aware about what cars can do to the environment and that car usage needs to decrease, and they are taking steps to do so. So why should you limit your car usage? By limiting car usage, the average citizen can decrease pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that are causing damage to the environment, improve living conditions in large cities and reduce smog, and feel better in general, with more exercise and less stress.

In the past decade, America has struggled with an obesity epidemic. In the early 2000s, obesity was at its peak, with mcdonald's ""Super Size"" menu options, huge SUVs, and endless television programs to keep couch potatos on the couch. If you visit New York City's Manhattan, you won't see a whole lot of obese people hurrying down 5th avenue to hop on the subway or pick up groceries at the local market. Why is this? Not many people drive in NYC, mainly because it would be far too expensive to buy and park a car in this already monumentally expensive city. The cars one does generally see are either from out of state, taxis, or businessmen who live in the other boroughs of the city. Very few who live in Manhattan drive. Most people take the subway, walk, or use bikes to get around. Because of the way it's made, everything one needs is just a few blocks away, from the grocery store, to the drugstore, to the postoffice, to the bank, there really is no need to have a car. If you have to go to the airport, just take a cab. Naturally, people who walk and bike everywhere are slimmer and healthier. In the suburbs, this is not the story. Many people in the suburbs drive cars out necessity, because it would take the whole day to walk to the grocery store and back. The way suburbs are set up, walking or biking is almost impossible to do if it's not for leisure. Driving around all day to pick up kids, go to work, and finally pull into the home garage can be draining and stressful. If people were to get around and get exercise at the same time, they would be less stressed and healthier. Andrew Selsky quoted businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in his article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". Plaza said that, ""It's limiting car usage a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Many people are already doing this. Vauban, Germany, is a new ""carfree"" suburb. In this town, things are close together, just like a city, eliminating the need to use cars. It is not illegal to own a car in Vauban, but people who do must pay a heavy fine and pay for parking on the edge of the city that is also highly expensive. People in the German suburb get along fine without cars, because of the way the city was built. The idea of a ""carreduced"" community appeals to the U.S. as well, and legislators and other government officials are trying to make it happen for the environment as well as the sake of the people.

Bejjing is supposedly the most polluted city in the world, and Paris the most beautiful, but Paris is more polluted than one would think. Robert Duffer reports in his article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", that Paris, after suffering from ""five days of intensive smog"" called for some drivers to abstain from using their cars for the day or face a fine of twentytwo euros. The system was based on license plate numbers. One day, the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be able to drive, the next the ones with odd numbered license plates. This helped reduce smog in the city, which is more polluted than others in Europe like Brussels and London. Once the smog cleared, the ban was rescinded. This ban on cars, although only for a short period of time, is actually a great idea. Emissions from cars cause a large amount of smog to pollute the air, which is bad for both the inhabitants of the city and the environment. The reduction of the use of cars will reduce the amount of smog in the air in large cities, and improve the living conditions in those cities. Almost two centuries ago, smog, soot, and dirt covered Victorian London and its people. This smog was not from cars, but rather from the rising popularity of factories powered by fossil fuels such as coal. Today, all cities of the world are polluted, and almost two hundred years have passed. Shouldn't some improvements regarding the environment and smog in cities have been made by now? There is just as much environmental damage being done as there was in 19th century London, but now, instead of factories being the main cause, it's cars. Although cities are cleaner now, they are just as polluted. In Bejjing, some say the air is so dirty that if you blow your nose, your tissue turns black! It is the 21st century, and we have to be taking strides to improve the environment for the good of the people who live in cities like Paris and Bejjing.

Limiting car usage is important to create a better living environment for people as well as improve their wellbeing, but the most important reason is to limit pollution and damage to the environment due to emmisions from cars. President Obama, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, ""The End of Car Culture"", has ""ambitious goals to curb the Unites States' greenhouse gas emissions"". If the President of the United States is concerned, this means it is a real problem. The immense amount of greenhouse gases caused by cars has already aided Global Warming and the damage to the ozone layer that exists today. If car usage increases or holds steady, even more damage will be done, so much so that it may become unfixable in the future. If the world does not cut back now on its vehicle usage and reduce environmental damage, things will only get harder to fix. But things are looking good for Mother Nature, because according to all four articles given, including, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, people are already taking steps to reduce the use of cars and better the environment.

Ever since the Model T came out in the early 20th century, cars have become more and more popular in America as well as around the world. They have become so popular, in fact, that they have become a problem. Cars emit harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment and cause excess smog in large cities. They can also be stressful and unhealthy for people who depend on them for everyday modes of transport. Limiting car usage is important and will help not only the environment, but also the people of the world.",151,27,0.6966,0.187,0.9706,0.4812,0.5807,25.25,684,788,"[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1]",1,4.0185
2738,"When limiting car usage the first thing that most everyone thinks of is: ""How would I get from Point A to Point B instead of driving myself in my car? Would I walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or try and find a new creative approach?"" Limiting car usage is not the end of the world, it is the beginning of a healthy one. Most cars burn gas which cause smog and pollution which is harmful to the enviorment, some people get lazy and end up being so dependent on a vehicle that they will not even consider walking a few blocks to a friend's house for an afternoon lunch, and our own ancestors have gone without a car for centuries on end. So would it really be that much of a struggle to not use a car any and every where that you go? You do not need to never use your car again, you just need to realize that using your vehicle more than needed is harming not just yourself, but everything and everyone you interact with in life.

In Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the 'City of Love and Romance' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following days.""(""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer). However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When Duffer's article was published he states, ""Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matter(PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few seconds(do not actually attempt this analogy) it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer. If the smog in one of the biggest cities in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage, imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day. What if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item? You can change your whole enviorment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive 10 miles down the road.

The law that was put affect in Paris, France does not state that you can never drive your vehicle again, it is just simply asking the citizens to go one day without their vehicle. ""But what if I have to go somewhere such as work, school, or anywhere else that I want?"" Paris is a large city, that much is understood, because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from Point A to Point B. One way is public transportation from the city and/or local businesses, like a bus or tram.  According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday as well. So, if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem. If you do not like public transportation, or do not prefer it, you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk. Getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay. Also, you are getting exercise out of it which benefits your health. Walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many ways. If you see someone familiar walking towards you, you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going. As well as this, if you see a small shop or stand that sparks your interest you have easier access to explore inside. If you were driving/riding in a vehicle then you would have to cross traffic, find a parking spot, make sure you grabbed everything that you need, and make sure that it is locked. If you are taking a stroll through town, you already have your needed things, you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot, and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed. A study discovered by Elisabeth Rosenthal found out that driving by youth decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe this is because young people still have the energy and sense of adventure in them to walk or take a bus somewhere(or they just can not afford it, which in the long run saves them money anyway). Maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car. Maybe taking public transportation is not as crowded and as much of a hassle as the movies make it seem. Taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different backgrounds as well. You can meet someone that you might not see as a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are. Some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new names. With public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new. Why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving? The question still remains, why not?

Limiting your vehicle usage does not limit your options and exposure to the outside world. Having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either. Some vehicles are 'eco friendly' and are built so they can help protect the enviorment. Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way. Driving is so stressful for a person. You have to focus on all of your surroundings, check every blind spot, make sure that all of your fluids are not empty, replacing tires, and so much more. Again, driving is not all bad. Some people enjoy to drive, some say that is relaxes them and gives them time to think because driving is the only 'alone time' that they have. Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The human race has survived countless centuries without motor vehicles, why can we not seem to last just a day?

971,"In today's day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of di? erent drivers with di? erent experiences and di? erent skills behind the wheel. Many people take pride in their ability to mulBtask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing tra? c with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back. But a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distracBon since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them. This is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in America with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly. Reasons like this is why most cars don't have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distracBon to the driver. Driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like

Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, and Illinois with a ?ne of $50,00 and up to 1 year in prison. The main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

The ?rst reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash. It's been documented that 19% of drivers of all ages admit to sur? ng the web while driving. In a blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it states,""This one is preWy obvious, but did you know that you are 23 Bmes more likely to crash if you text and drive? According to the NaBonal Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes due to texBng while driving happen each year. If you don't want to crash your car and get injured or even killed, don't text and drive."" These staBsBcs show just how dangerous texBng and driving is and why people shouldn't overlook this issue as it is a naBonal problem that doesn't get published enough. Most people like to ignore the problem of texBng while driving as they might have grown up with older ?gures who do the same. A good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an arBcle that states,""Cell phone use while driving staBsBcs and texBng and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the NaBonal Highway Tra? c Safety AdministraBon, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distracBon-a? ected crashes, accounBng for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving staBsBcs and texBng and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. TexBng while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and staBsBcs show that this mulBtasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texBng while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains o? the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers."" This arBcle shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think it's okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though it's never safe. It also shows how since most teens just start o? driving they are inexperienced and don't know how to mulBtask. A car crash is one of the most traumaBzing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining

PTSD from the experience. With that being said using your phone while mulBtasking in the car could result in a car crash.

The second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Many people use their phones while driving when they're with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,""Not only does texBng and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to menBon pedestrians who oben end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to noBce them while looking at the phone in your lap."" This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people's wrongdoing might a? ect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you're willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an arBcle that says,""Because technology will change and new distracBons will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is conBnuously aWenBve and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracBng devices while driving.

According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the bene? ts of pugng away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks."" This arBcle makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can a? ect someone's mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be beWer drivers. Pugng their friends at risk and potenBally harming them is something that nobody wants to do. Which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving.

In conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

Drivers should stop trying to mulBtask everything and do everything at once and just pay aWenBon to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one sel? sh person decides to not pay aWenBon and drive around clueless then everyone else su? ers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to sBll put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences gegng caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all mulBtasking while driving by using your phone only shows impaBence and immaturity. TexBng and driving has caused six Bmes more deaths than drunk driving yet people sBll shrug it o? due to them thinking they can manage to keep their aWenBon in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their Bme on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a noB?caBon immediately and wait and do it when the Bme is right.

42281,"When limiting car usage the first thing that most everyone thinks of is: ""How would I get from Point A to Point B instead of driving myself in my car? Would I walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or try and find a new creative approach?"" Limiting car usage is not the end of the world, it is the beginning of a healthy one. Most cars burn gas which cause smog and pollution which is harmful to the environment, some people get lazy and end up being so dependent on a vehicle that they will not even consider walking a few blocks to a friend's house for an afternoon lunch, and our own ancestors have gone without a car for centuries on end. So would it really be that much of a struggle to not use a car any and every where that you go? You do not need to never use your car again, you just need to realize that using your vehicle more than needed is harming not just yourself, but everything and everyone you interact with in life.

In Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the city of Love and Romance' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following days.""""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer. However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When buffer's article was published he states, ""Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matterPM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few secondsdo not actually attempt this analogy it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the oddnumbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer. If the smog in one of the biggest cities in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage, imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day. What if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item? You can change your whole environment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive 10 miles down the road.

The law that was put affect in Paris, France does not state that you can never drive your vehicle again, it is just simply asking the citizens to go one day without their vehicle. ""But what if I have to go somewhere such as work, school, or anywhere else that I want?"" Paris is a large city, that much is understood, because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from Point A to Point B. One way is public transportation from the city andor local businesses, like a bus or tram. According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday as well. So, if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem. If you do not like public transportation, or do not prefer it, you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk. Getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay. Also, you are getting exercise out of it which benefits your health. Walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many ways. If you see someone familiar walking towards you, you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going. As well as this, if you see a small shop or stand that sparks your interest you have easier access to explore inside. If you were drivingriding in a vehicle then you would have to cross traffic, find a parking spot, make sure you grabbed everything that you need, and make sure that it is locked. If you are taking a stroll through town, you already have your needed things, you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot, and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed. A study discovered by Elisabeth Rosenthal found out that driving by youth decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe this is because young people still have the energy and sense of adventure in them to walk or take a bus somewhereor they just can not afford it, which in the long run saves them money anyway. Maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car. Maybe taking public transportation is not as crowded and as much of a hassle as the movies make it seem. Taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different backgrounds as well. You can meet someone that you might not see as a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are. Some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new names. With public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new. Why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving? The question still remains, why not?

Limiting your vehicle usage does not limit your options and exposure to the outside world. Having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either. Some vehicles are 'eco friendly' and are built so they can help protect the environment. Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way. Driving is so stressful for a person. You have to focus on all of your surroundings, check every blind spot, make sure that all of your fluids are not empty, replacing tires, and so much more. Again, driving is not all bad. Some people enjoy to drive, some say that is relaxes them and gives them time to think because driving is the only 'alone time' that they have.

11645,"In a school, there are clasrooms upon classrooms that are all teaching different, new, and exciting classes. When walking down a hallway, it is more than possible that the sounds of logorithmic functions could be taught to your left as Shakespeare might be being recited to your right. If you take a turn, one kid may be leaving his photography class to go take pictures for the yearbook while another may be returning from the restroom to go back to her chemistry class where she is studying saturated and unstaurated solutions. Despite the intense differences and varities of classes that there are at a high school, not every one of them is ""new"", ""different"", and ""exciting,"" as used previously to describe the classrooms scenes to all kids. Therefore, if it were at all possible that these kids could feel and want to be more engaged in their classes that take up a large portion of their week and youth, the way to do so should be evident in the classrooms. With this in mind, the idea that using Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable is not only true, but something that should be acted upon. (D'Alto).

In the life of someone that is attending school, there is one idea that is always looming over their shoulder. Whether it be like a cloud on a rainy day or a shadow following them on a sunny one, grades are always an important factor in a school-goer's life. Therefore, if this porgram would be able to help kids to be more interested in a topic and be more involved, they may just have improved grades from this system. In the text, the excerpt, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts,"" shows that student's attention could be analyazed. (D'Alto, 6). With this being done, if the computer would be able to recgonize confusion, the student could then be introduced to a better way to learn the material or a way that they beter understand it, then leading to better grades. (D'Alto, 6). Also, the grades of the students could improve based on what the computer decides to do with as much human touch as it can. The passage, ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" shows that there is a solution to any problems a kid may have with what they are learning. (D'Alto 6). The fact that the computer attempts to try and help the students with a human touch shows that it would have the capibilties to do it's best and help the students to learn better, overall improving the student's grades. (D'Alto 6). With both of these examples in mind, it can be seen that the inclusion of this sytem into classrooms would have the capability to improve both a student's grades and understanding.

When a kid is sitting in a classroom for an hour, atleast, every day to every other day, there is seemable reason as to why and how a kid could get easily side tracked and/or bored. Despite this being true, the inclusion of this program into student's lives may have the ability to greatly improve student's engagement and interest in the classroom. In this article, the author includes, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too,'"" shows just how the students may become more engaged and interested in their classes that take up so much of their week days. (D'Alto 6). If the computers would be able to connect with the students, there is no reason that these kids would not feel more obligatred to pay attention and more interested to learn what is being taught. (D'Alto 6). Another reason that these kids would gain more by having this system in their schools is the idea that would engage them in a fun manner. When the author included, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can really do,"" the reason is stated so in the text. (D'Alto 6). By including this piece, the author is showing that there, overall, is a fun factor to this could intrigue the students and keep them interested in their assignments and school overall. With these two ideas in mind, it can be seen that, as the attention of students is a primary need for schools, if this could improve just that, there is no reason not to include it in student's lives.

As science is an ever-budding field by it's own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn't thrive among those interested in both science and technology. Therefore, as this is something that is new and up and coming, the addition of this to clasrooms may spark a pasion for this subject and inspire a career to form. In the excerpt, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,"" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,"" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

As kids are ever-subject to new and upcoming ideas, it is evident that the addition of recent techology could aid their progression in school and would be deemed as important and valuable to include. If a kid were someone that easily lost interest in a course or was not very interested in a certain class, they may then be more provoked to learn and pay attention if this new technology was included at their school and interested them. By doing so, there is potential that the student would then be able to improve their grade and get much out of this porgram. Also, if a student were to be even intrigued in this technology, there could be potential for this studen to go into a job field that dealt with this type of technology as there are many that vary greatly in doing so. Overall, the inclusion of present innovations and technology should be including the next generations, as success for them now will lead to future success for all.",213,7,0.9364,0.2703,0.9665,0.4077,0.5497,29.0816,554,657,"[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 6, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]",0,4.1165
1345,"All around the world, people are using gas-gusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""Car-Free Day"" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partial-driving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a long-term positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of green-house gases is one of the common issues troubling countries world-wide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depleation of Earth's Ozone layer. According to

Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,

""[The Smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" The city of Paris had legislated, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day"" (

Source 2

). Resulting from their legislation, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (

Source 2

). Paris, originally one of the worlds' most-polluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the odd-numbered license plates the next day. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (

Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

). A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the Car-Free Day was ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (

Source 3: Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota

). The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban; there would be no energy-crisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the beta-countries (France, Colombia, and Germany) have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on

Source 3 , in Bogota, ""... a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Rather than having a holier-than-thou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the car-free day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to

Source 3 , ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bike-sharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to

Source 4: The End of Car Culture , ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of car-sharinf programs across the nation."" Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The long-term culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to

Source 4 , ""The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (

Source 1

). Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" (

Source 1

). This modern-day industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

Source 1 also states that ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning""."" The beta countries have had much success and have not seen failure yet. Although in France, ""Almost 4,000 dricers were fined... [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" (

Source 2

), it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The long-term culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and long-term culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a car-free enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.            ",133,27,0.6625,0.1778,0.9635,0.4785,0.5768,19.2319,602,742,"[1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 6, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]",3,4.4589
342,"Phones & Driving

Waking up from a wonderful dream, you look around to what you can describe as your dull or gloomy-like room. Without even realizing, you've already picked up your phone and start to browse your social media. You check the time and go look outside your window and it looks like a wonderful day. You quickly decide to blast your music and dress up fashionably before you go out to your friend's place. Alast you finish by taking many, many selfies and videos and then share them all to your friends and a few social media platforms while getting in the car. Now you've started the car and are now on the way to your friend's house as planned before. On your drive, text messages start to ring your phone a lot and people try calling you. Meanwhile you are on the highway. Mind you, you just started driving two weeks before, so you're practically new to this.

At this point you only have two options, are you willing to get on this phone while driving? Or should you wait until your vehicle is at rest? You want to convince yourself that it may be an emergency but is it really a smart decision to fiddle with that device while driving? Let alone on a highway at about 75 mph? Which leads to the topic of this essay, whether or not a driver should use their cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In general, cell phones are a huge distraction to society itself. Some in a good way, such as passing by time. But some in a dangerous way, such as operating a vehicle. Let's talk about how dangerous this is. According to research, reasons you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is pretty obvious. It's dangerous in numerous ways, as little as two second distraction is just enough to see who's calling and texting your cell phone but it's also just enough time to get you into a crash and cause chaos. Those few moments of looking at your phone rather than the road you're moving far and even enough to where you wouldn't see any pedestrians, motorcycles/bikes, or another person unexpectedly braking in front of you. Apparently stats show that cell phone use while operating a vehicle has increased with an added fact that 18 to 29 years olds are more than likely to be the people trying to access phones while driving. While that age group tends to have the high frequency of doing so, research supports that the age group over 65 have the lowest frequency. It wouldn't even be smart to use a phone at traffic lights. You may fail to go at the green light and that's when the illegal part comes in. There are tremendous amounts of consequences that can happen from driving all being, punishable or harmful.

In comparison, many other people may disagree and say that using a phone could be helpful. Based upon research, people claim there are great benefits to using your cell phone while driving. People feel they can use cell phones while driving safely with the help of hands-free technology. With laws banning hands-on behind the wheel impacting regions, drivers are saying that it's the typing of letters which takes too long that makes it dangerous. Even though people using hands-free devices and hands-on devices are equally bound to end up in a car accident, hands-free drivers tend to get fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than drivers using hands-on cell phones. More research states that pros of using a cellphone are for lifeline, navigation, cameras, traffic reports, and crime reporting. Drivers may need lifeline for road-side assistance for problems like car accidents where time is tight or paramedics and other emergency contacts that may be needed. Navigation assists drivers in locationing and maps providing real-time traffic reports, this supports the hands-free benefit of cell phones by a lot because it is very much needed. Cameras are important for quick situations such as car crashes. The person may need to hurry and catch a picture of the licence plate of whom might be performing a hit and run. Traffic reports provide drivers with up-to-date traffic updates on traffic jams, highway closings, and accidents. And lastly crime reporting for suspicious and illegal actions a driver may have spotted. With research it's clear many drivers can support that there are ways to operate vehicles while driving safely.

In my opinion, there shouldn't necessarily be any use of a cell phone while operating a vehicle. It's very dangerous and can cause people to be harmed badly and even bring death upon people. I feel that bluetooth music, texting, and calls, are not an excuse to grab the phone while driving. All texts and calls can wait because little do you know your life's on the line especially when your vehicle is moving at any type of speed. And music can be changed within good time management. I understand that people may have jobs that may require them to use their phones while driving and that's where advanced technology takes place. Advanced technology is allowing vehicles to assist drivers for safety or the vehicle may even drive itself. Hands-free cell phone usage has been promoted but now more safely than ever in this generation but I still feel that even all of the hands-free technology can even be quite an amount of distractions. Mind you one of the biggest and important rules of driving is to focus on the road. It may be hard sometimes considering that at young ages cell phones are practically habitual and it's almost like we need them for everything. Notice how in the introduction I brought how a cell phone is being used. That was to show how big of a role a cell phone plays in our lives, and me mentioning being a new driver was to have a bigger as to why the phone shouldn't be used. Using a cell phone while driving is very, very dangerous to you, and even others in some cases.

In conclusion, if causing harm and chaos is the last thing you want, the suggestion should be to not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Hands-free may sound great and all but it can be just as risky as hands-on cell phones. Surely the messages and calls being received can wait until after your drive. There is no need to add on top of stats like accidents because of cell phones. As the saying goes ""safety first!"" And that safety plays a big role in everything, in this case driving.

Now back to the questions. Are you willing to get on this phone while driving? Or should you wait until your vehicle is at rest? What's your decision?

2069,"Have you ever realized how driving everywhere isn't always the best way to get places? Well, there are a few advantages of limiting car usage for fellow citizens. Think about it, cars aren't all that great, yeah they get you to your destination much faster than, let's say walking or maybe even riding a bike, but that isn't always a good thing. Bikes and walking are so much easier than driving everywhere because in order to drive to your destination you must have gasoline in your vehicle. If you were to walk to your specific destination you will not only get excercise but you can also walk with a friend, it will give you time to hang out with others and be social! Limiting car usage will also limit the amount of accidents on the roads everyday. It will end the ""texting and driving"" situation throughout the streets. The less people driving the safer the ones that do drive will be. People don't realize what cars do that are bad, all of us only see the good in vehicles because we don't want to have to push ourselves to change for the better.

Oh my! $2.56 for a gallon of gasoline will add up very quickly! That isn't the only gasoline that is affecting people either, there is also greenhouse gas from cars driving by. ""And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emisions from tailpipes..."" (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars (IGS) Paragraph 5 Line 3-4). The greenhouse gas percentage has gotten very high going from Europe to the United States, it is getting quite out of hand if you ask me. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source 1 (IGS) Paragraph 5 Lines 4-6). Prices on gasoline stand very high now a days and it is bringing people downhill because the higher the price the less money they begin to have until they can't go out anymore. In result to trying to solve the pollution of gasoline problem the fined who ever it was that was causing the situation. ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters... [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog (PBDS) Paragraph 12 Lines 1-3). I believe that every country, state and city should take at least one day out of the year and make it a no driving day. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Source 2: (PBDS) Paragraph 10 Lines 1-2). If we do the same as Paris we can clear the air and not worry about the pollution as much but there are still other disadvantages for car usage.

Lifting weights? Joining a gym? Those are all good ways to get your excercise but really you could just get in the habit of walking to wear you need to go and get more excercise than you would in the gym. ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs."" (Source 1 (IGS) Paragraph 6 Lines 1-3). Making the cities denser will mean that the citizens who live in them can walk to the stores and resturaunts down the street instead of driving. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" (Source 1 (IGS) Paragraph 6 Lines 8-10). Not to mention the traffic while driving! Walking to your destination will make getting places so much more afficient because you won't have to be late to a meeting or even work at that matter if it is walking distance. ""Congestion (car traffic) was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" (Source 2: (PBDS) Paragraph 14 Lines 1-2). If there are less cars on the street and more people on the sidewalks, the world wouldn't be so gloomy. No one is social anymore, they don't care for others they only care for themselves and that is very wrong. If the limit of car usage decreases, the more people will want to walk and be social with others.

Watch out for that....! *crash!* Safety is so important when you are driving, accidents happen so quickly and if you aren't careful it could be you. This is another reason why limiting car usage is a rather good idea because it will cause accidents to happen less often than they do now. Car accidents happen everyday, maybe to a complete stranger or to someone you know, either way walking is safer. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota (CFDB) Paragraph 20 Lines 1-4). Walking to places is more, what's the word I'm looking for..? Oh! Walking is more social and safe, if you took one whole day without using your car, you could walk and as others catch on to why you are walking they will begin to walk along with you and you will develop the idea that walking is more fun and safe than driving. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Source 3: (PBDS) Paragraph 28 Lines 1-4). More people will begin to go out and walk for fun after getting in the habit of going with you and you can enjoy the world so much more knowing that the air isn't being as polluting and there won't be a many car accidents. You will save yourself and whoever follows through with you to limit the usage or cars and other vehicles.

Get a few of your friends together and go for a bike ride to the mall! There are some advantages of limiting car usage. Being in your car, whether it be alone or with others, is quite boring. You get to places very quickly but also don't have the experience that you could if you try something different. Try walking to the mall or a resturaunt not so close to you and bring some of your friends, see if you have more of a good time walking than you would driving. Driving is too expensive, you need to pay insurance to drive as well as paying to get gasoline. ""With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" (Source 4: The End Of Car Culture (TEOC) Paragraph 36 Lines 1-2). People are beginning to realize that cars are not all that great and don't do good for the world, they pollute the air we breathe. The less people to drive the better our cities will be, they will start to have less pollution in the air, less car accidents and more excercise to walk and bike to where you need to be. Be the one to make the clear the air day, and be a role model, show others why you decided to limit car usage.

2833,"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city and/or regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a time-consuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almost-broken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semi-trucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bike-sharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridge/tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our number-one priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work; taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds; or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to; it's the journey.

43188,"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city andor regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a timeconsuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almostbroken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semitrucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashesaccidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bikesharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridgetunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our numberone priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car.

42649,"All around the world, people are using gasgusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""CarFree Day"" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partialdriving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a longterm positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases is one of the common issues troubling countries worldwide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depletion of Earth's Ozone layer. According to Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog, ""The Smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" The city of Paris had legislate, ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day"" . Resulting from their legislation, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"" . Paris, originally one of the worlds' mostpolluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the oddnumbered license plates the next day. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the CarFree Day was ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Source 3: CarFree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota . The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban there would be no energycrisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the betacountries France, Colombia, and Germany have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on Source 3 , in Bogota, ""... a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Rather than having a holierthanthou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the carfree day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to Source 3 , ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bikesharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to Source 4: The End of Car Culture , ""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of carsharinf programs across the nation."" Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The longterm culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to Source 4 , ""The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" . Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" . This modernday industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

Source 1 also states that ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning""."" The beta countries have had much success and have not seen failure yet. Although in France, ""Almost 4,000 dricers were fined... Twentyseven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" , it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The longterm culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and longterm culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a carfree enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.",133,27,0.6625,0.1856,0.9731,0.4911,0.5857,26.3061,600,732,"[1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 6, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]",3,4.5159
2136,"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the polititians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this ""car-free"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anti-car revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing ""car-free"" city club by starting a program that sponsers a car-free day once a year.

Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completley inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundancy of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.

Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completley eradicate driving completley so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completley banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week.

After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completley banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s according to the article titled ""Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city.

Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article ""The End Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to car-pooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.

42767,"Have you ever realized how driving everywhere isn't always the best way to get places? Well, there are a few advantages of limiting car usage for fellow citizens. Think about it, cars aren't all that great, yeah they get you to your destination much faster than, let's say walking or maybe even riding a bike, but that isn't always a good thing. Bikes and walking are so much easier than driving everywhere because in order to drive to your destination you must have gasoline in your vehicle. If you were to walk to your specific destination you will not only get exercise but you can also walk with a friend, it will give you time to hang out with others and be social! Limiting car usage will also limit the amount of accidents on the roads everyday. It will end the ""texting and driving"" situation throughout the streets. The less people driving the safer the ones that do drive will be. People don't realize what cars do that are bad, all of us only see the good in vehicles because we don't want to have to push ourselves to change for the better.

Oh my! 2.56 for a gallon of gasoline will add up very quickly! That isn't the only gasoline that is affecting people either, there is also greenhouse gas from cars driving by. ""And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe..."" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars IGS Paragraph 5 Line 34. The greenhouse gas percentage has gotten very high going from Europe to the United States, it is getting quite out of hand if you ask me. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Source 1 IGS Paragraph 5 Lines 46. Prices on gasoline stand very high now a days and it is bringing people downhill because the higher the price the less money they begin to have until they can't go out anymore. In result to trying to solve the pollution of gasoline problem the fined who ever it was that was causing the situation. ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters... Twentyseven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog PBDS Paragraph 12 Lines 13. I believe that every country, state and city should take at least one day out of the year and make it a no driving day. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Source 2: PBDS Paragraph 10 Lines 12. If we do the same as Paris we can clear the air and not worry about the pollution as much but there are still other disadvantages for car usage.

Lifting weights? Joining a gym? Those are all good ways to get your exercise but really you could just get in the habit of walking to wear you need to go and get more exercise than you would in the gym. ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs."" Source 1 IGS Paragraph 6 Lines 13. Making the cities denser will mean that the citizens who live in them can walk to the stores and resturaunts down the street instead of driving. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Source 1 IGS Paragraph 6 Lines 810. Not to mention the traffic while driving! Walking to your destination will make getting places so much more afficient because you won't have to be late to a meeting or even work at that matter if it is walking distance. ""Congestion car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" Source 2: PBDS Paragraph 14 Lines 12. If there are less cars on the street and more people on the sidewalks, the world wouldn't be so gloomy. No one is social anymore, they don't care for others they only care for themselves and that is very wrong. If the limit of car usage decreases, the more people will want to walk and be social with others.

Watch out for that....! crash! Safety is so important when you are driving, accidents happen so quickly and if you aren't careful it could be you. This is another reason why limiting car usage is a rather good idea because it will cause accidents to happen less often than they do now. Car accidents happen everyday, maybe to a complete stranger or to someone you know, either way walking is safer. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota CFDB Paragraph 20 Lines 14. Walking to places is more, what's the word I'm looking for..? Oh! Walking is more social and safe, if you took one whole day without using your car, you could walk and as others catch on to why you are walking they will begin to walk along with you and you will develop the idea that walking is more fun and safe than driving. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Source 3: PBDS Paragraph 28 Lines 14. More people will begin to go out and walk for fun after getting in the habit of going with you and you can enjoy the world so much more knowing that the air isn't being as polluting and there won't be a many car accidents. You will save yourself and whoever follows through with you to limit the usage or cars and other vehicles.

Get a few of your friends together and go for a bike ride to the mall! There are some advantages of limiting car usage. Being in your car, whether it be alone or with others, is quite boring. You get to places very quickly but also don't have the experience that you could if you try something different. Try walking to the mall or a resturaunt not so close to you and bring some of your friends, see if you have more of a good time walking than you would driving. Driving is too expensive, you need to pay insurance to drive as well as paying to get gasoline. ""With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" Source 4: The End Of Car Culture TEOC Paragraph 36 Lines 12. People are beginning to realize that cars are not all that great and don't do good for the world, they pollute the air we breathe. The less people to drive the better our cities will be, they will start to have less pollution in the air, less car accidents and more exercise to walk and bike to where you need to be. Be the one to make the clear the air day, and be a role model, show others why you decided to limit car usage.",164,24,0.7447,0.2194,0.9725,0.4493,0.5687,22.7143,610,741,"[2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 5, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 0, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3]",8,3.9539
97,"Should Drivers use Cell phones while driving?

What would we do without the latest technologies in our daily life? We use computers for work and in school, we use cell phones to access apps and do research. At home, we use microwaves to heat up food and landlines have been replaced by cell phones as the main phone of many people. In our daily lives we use cell phones to text, look up boarding passes, check flights and make phone calls. More and more, people are using technology, including cell phones, as an important part of their lives. As more and more people become dependent on the use of cell phones, some of the time they are being used may be in a car, while driving. Is the cell phone more helpful or hurtful when they are used by drivers in a car?

While a small minority of people do not have cell phones, the prevalence of cell phone ownership and use has increased. ""Cell phone usage is becoming a mounting issue in the United States with 91% of Americans (97% of people between 18-24) owning cell phones and using them for texting, calling and communicating for personal, work and school in daily life."" (""Cell Phone ownership""). Cell phones are so in trend with their convenience and popularity they seem to be increasing in numbers and not decreasing. ""Eighty-one percent of Americans own smart phones up from 35% in the 2011"" (""Mobile Fact Sheet""). It seems that more people are becoming dependent on them, despite the potential risks. For teens, texting has become more popular as making a phone call. Starting in the year 2001, State governments have started creating laws to limit cell phone usage by individuals driving in cars, as risks arise.

Despite the controversy there are benefits of cellphones especially for teenage students, who are now using new technologies during the school year. Cell phones are becoming more popular in school as a learning aid. ""In a recent poll 94% of students use their phones in class for learning"" (""Cell phone use""). The Majority of U.S. students are now relying on cell phones to get their school assignments and homework done. Since these teens have the cell phones in their possession, as they drive to school, they may be tempted to use them, both texting and calling, while they are behind the wheel. The benefits of this immediate communication with others and the convenience it creates, it may be outweighed by the risks and dangers of this usage.

In contrast to the benefits for cell phones, the dangers of distracted driving are real. Starting in the 2000's, States have started to restrict the use of cell phones while driving mainly due to the incidence of car accidents involving a driver using their cell phone. The fatalities do not just include the driver, but also the passengers and other victims. ""Twenty states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have hand-held cell phone use bans and thirty-eight states ban all cell phone use by novice and teen drivers"" (""Distracted Driving Laws""). ""Cell phone use while driving causing distracted driving has been linked to automobile accidents and fatalities"". (""Distracted Driving Laws""). The increase in accidents associated with cell phones is still controversial and there are arguments on both sides as far as the causes.

Some surprising emerging data shows a benefit of cell phones is their use in emergency situations. ""Patients are more likely to survive when emergency services are called from a cell phone rather than a landline"" (Weinlich). ""It is associated with improved mortality rates at the scene of medical events"" (""Mobile Phones proven""). Drivers may use their cell phones while driving to report an emergency. As more people continue to use cell phones more people may be able to helped and potentially saved in emergencies. Is the risk of distracted driving worth the potential benefit of helping someone in distress?

In addition to the risk associated with distracted driving there is another health risk associated with phone use. ""Cell phones give off a form of energy known as radiofrequency (RF) waves."" (""Cell Phone Safety""). And while this risk occurs whether the person is driving or not, it would be another reason for the driver to adhere to the handsfree laws. The concern has been a link that shows increasing risk of brain tumors of the head and neck while the driver holds the phone to the face (Creagan). ""The evidence is mixed though and there is limited evidence linking cell phone radiation to human cancer"" (""Electromagnetic Fields""). The mounting risks and seeming benefits for the driver are numerous and careful consideration must be used when considering using a cell phone while driving.

Overall phones have changed society for the better and for the worse. Since their introduction, the cell phone has significantly changed how people talk and has increased the convenience of personal communication. But the life-changing benefits of the cell phone come with many controversial risks. The negative effects of deaths from distracted driving along with other health concerns cannot be overlooked. Many distracted cell phone driver accidents occur with young teenage drivers actively using their cellphones while operating a motor vehicle. While these events may make the evening news, they will never bring back the special life of that driver, the passengers or others that may have been hurt or killed. More private and government agencies need to further expose the dangerous links of driver cell phone use to human health. There is a great need to further educate the public of these risks. Having these agencies along with Hollywood, TV and social media, where images and messaging catch teens attention, could positively educate drivers and shape what safe cellphone usage looks like. This positive action may ultimately save lives.

42154,"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the politicians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this ""carfree"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anticar revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticeably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing ""carfree"" city club by starting a program that sponsors a carfree day once a year.

Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completely inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundance of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.

Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completely eradicate driving completely so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completely banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week.

After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completely banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""CarFree Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid1990s according to the article titled ""CarFree Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city.

Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article ""The End Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to carpooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.",138,13,0.8278,0.1902,0.9858,0.5019,0.5951,34.4474,618,715,"[2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 6, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 5, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2]",0,4.3575

Over the past decade, technology has been deeply integrated into our lives to the point where we couldn't live without it. One of those technologies is our phones. Phones are constantly being used; from texting and talking to watching movies and playing games. People are constantly using them and it seems like you can't go anywhere without your phone. Because of this, there's been a dramatic rise in car accidents caused by phone distractions. States have passed laws banning cell phone use while driving, however, this really hasn't achieved much.

There are still many people looking down at their laps instead of looking at the road. Phones are helpful while driving for things like navigation or music, but drivers shouldn't be checking their social media or texting while driving. This diverts their focus from what's happening on the road, leading to an accident. While driving, drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones.

In the United States alone nearly 390,000 car accidents occur each year due to drivers being on their phones. ""1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.""(Snyder). A survey done by CBS News found that ""98 percent of motorists who own cellphones and text regularly said that they were aware of the dangers, yet three-quarters of them admitted to texting while driving...""(Ap, 1). So even though most people are aware of the dangers, why do they continue you to use their phones while driving? According to the same CBS article, most of the people who do use their phones believe they're good multi-taskers. In the article, they said, ""drivers believed they can ""easily do several things at once, even while driving"".""(Ap, 3). Most of these drivers honestly believe that they are competent enough to use their phones while driving but despite all their confidence, texting while driving is still ""6 times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving""(Snyder, 1). In a survey conducted in 2014 about 28% of the people surveyed said, ""they are worried about missing out of something important if they don't check their phones right away.""(Ap, 9). Another group, ""believed that others expect them to respond to texts ""right away"".""(Ap, 10). And a small percentage believed that they are, ""addicted to texting""(Ap, 11). For most of these people, it seems almost impossible for them to put their phones down for even a second. The constant use and over-reliance on phones have caused them to become very dependent on them. That means even while driving they are focusing on what's happening in the digital world on their phones, and not on the road they are driving on.

There are studies out there that say that banning cell phone use while driving has more positive effects than negative and that there are many benefits for allowing its use on the road. A study done by Harvard University found that using cell phones while driving, ""Decreased emergency response times/improved life-saving outcomes""(Ropeik,3). This is a common argument habitual cell phone users make. They say that they will be able to report an emergency or accident faster if they have their cell phones already in their hands, but the truth is that they are the ones that will probably cause that accident. Another argument made is, ""I was at a stoplight!"" (Schule, 5). This is one of the most common excuses made by drivers caught using their phones. They believe if they're stopped that they aren't a danger, however, this isn't the case. A poll done by the Huff Post revealed that 63% of drivers, aged between 18-29, text at red traffic lights. Another statistic showed that, ""More than 20 percent of distracted drivers age 15 to 19 involved in fatal crashes were distracted by cell phones...""(""Texting At A Red Light"", 4).

While on the road it is never safe to text, even while at a stoplight. ""Stalling to text could lead to rear-end crashes if the other drivers notice the light turn green first.""(""Texting At A Red Light"", 5). Almost, ""28% of all automobile accidents...""(Ryan, 1), are caused by rear-end collisions.

This is considered one of the largest categories of car accidents in the entire United States. One of the most common causes of rear-ends is distracted driving.

Most people believe that they are skilled enough drivers to be able to drive with distractions, but that's just not the case. This ignorance has caused thousands of people to lose their lives every year. You are more likely to die in a car accident than a plane crash, and that's because of how easy it is to be distracted while driving. Imagine a loved one being involved in a fatal accident because a driver was on their phone. It would be devastating. Phones have become such a huge part of our daily lives, and we should be able to utilize them in order to help better them. The bottom line is, they have the potential to cause a lot of damage when they aren't used appropriately and they should not be used while driving.

216,"Apple, Samsung, LG, Google Pixel, etc. all these company's make and design smartphones. Most people in the world own smartphones. People use smartphones so much that it can become a distraction. A big distraction is while driving people start using their phones and put themselves and other drivers at risk. Texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in the world. Most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them. People need to have their phones on them all the time. When they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing. When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.

Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.

When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.

Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, "" A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food."" As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.

Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.

2489,"Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered ""car-free"" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to ""Car-free Day"". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicals. The fights against polution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and Bagota, Colombia. And their efforts against polution is really starting to take ahold and become popular.

In Vauban, Germany- The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicals. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the ""experimental new district"". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000$. Just for a parking lot.

Resulting factors from this Car-Free suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicals. Vauban's residents seem to rather enjoy ""the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor."" Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called ""smart planning"". When finished in 2006 57 percent of it's residents sold their vehicals to move into the residence.

Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in low-car/carless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstate/highway.

Even though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New York-ian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950's. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vauban-like.

In Paris, France- Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it's residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with even-numbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31$ in American currency. The same ensued for those with odd-numbered plates the next day.

Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicals for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67% of all vehicals in France.

Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicals the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plug-in cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for odd-numbered plates a few days later.

In Bagota Colombia- Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring car-free day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to car-free day, all violators would be fined 25$. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city.

Despite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to Bagota to see the car-free event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders.

This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990's. Bagota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this car-free day.

Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down polution and smog levels.

The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cash-stapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicals and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.

Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to ""rebrand"" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 16-39 getting a license. Most people are turning to car-pooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.

Many countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against polution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, polution levels.

716,"Phones & Driving

Everyone sees drivers using their phones, but most people don't notice that sometimes it's you. Mobile devices have taken over during this technological era. The majority of people have and enjoy using phones. Whether they're looking at the newest post from someone on social media or texting a friend, family member, or stranger. Phones have the ability to keep people occupied for long or short periods of time. Using phones is okay until it comes to driving while using them. It turns into a whole new scenario where the user is gambling with their life with every tap, swipe, or click. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones for any reason while operating a motor vehicle; it puts you and others lives in danger, it is equally as bad as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and it's illegal in most states.

Distracted driving by the use of cellphones alone causes 2,600 deaths yearly. About 330,000 minor or major driving injuries too. Using mobile devices while driving impairs your ability to operate a motor vehicle. Forcing you to take your eyes off the road and focus your attention on it rather than the environment around you. Even if it's just for a couple of seconds, this can be devastating and lead to serious injury. Studies show that drivers who just talk to someone on a cellphone rather than texting respond to emergency braking situations 18 percent slower than if not. Imagine if these drivers were texting rather than just talking, putting their attention more into the message they're sending rather than the road in front of them. An emergency braking situation could be tragic for these drivers and lead to serious injury to them and the drivers in front and behind them. This shows that distracted driving can be devastating to you, and for the people in the vicinity. The danger caused by distracted driving is on par if not worse than driving under the influence.

Driving under the influence is seen as the sin of all driving, but is it really? A study done by Harvard University found that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs was very similar to driving distracted. 40 patients, nine percent of distracted drivers drove slower before breaking. 24 percent displayed an inability to keep pace with other cars because of the constant shifting of their attention. The same study found drunk drivers drove ""a bit"" slower than distracted and undistracted divers. With a serious increase of aggression, they pace cars more closely and more likely to break only seconds before a collision could occur. They also hit their breaks 23 percent harder than distracted and undistracted drivers. All participants had a BAC higher than 0.08 percent. The zebra's 2017 study states in 2015 drunk driving caused more deaths, while distracted caused more accidents. 10,265 drunk driving deaths vs 3,477 distracted driving deaths. 290,000 injuries caused by drunk driving vs 391,000 injuries caused by distracted driving. While drunk driving caused more deaths distracted driving caused more injuries, injuries that have the possibility of leaving permanent damage on the victim's body. Ruining innocent people's lives impeding what they once were good at just because a driver-focused their attention on their phone rather than their surroundings. States are now taking action against distracted driving to attempt to stop or at least cut down on driving accidents.

Currently, 48 states have banned texting and driving. Washington was the first state to ever pass any form of texting ban, doing it in 2007. 20 states have banned handheld cellphone use. No state has banned complete cellphone use, but 38 states have banned all cellphone use for teenagers who are operating the vehicle. All states who pass these laws all have a common goal. To lower distracted driver accident ratings for the state at hand, but do the laws work? Yes and no, California cell phone usage dropped 57% from 9.3% of drivers to 3.3% using their cellphones after the ban on handhelds in 2008. Even if the usage of cellphones dropped the crash ratings haven't this is where the no comes from. Bans in New York hope to see a decline in crash ratings, but there was basically no difference. The reason being drivers switched from handheld devices to using the car's new built-in interfaces to interact with the outside world. The new built-in interfaces aren't any safer like the companies claim they are and are just as bad when it comes to causing accidents. Banning the use of cellphones while driving did work because the use of actual cellphones dropped, but with new car technology allowing cellphones to connect to the car's interface the risk and threat of distracted driving is still just as bad.

Driving distracted isn't okay, and it never will be. It's the root of a majority of driving accidents. It can cause injury to you and the people around often fatal. It can even cost someone their life. It isn't as life-threatening as driving under the influence, but it's still dangerous.

Driving bans have lowered ratings cellphone use while operating a vehicle, but they still fail in stopping accidents. No matter how many laws are pushed or lives are taken driving distracted is here to stay unless something major changes. Car manufacturers are creating new technology that makes it easier than ever to drive distracted. It's a losing battle and it only gets worse by the year. Drivers shouldn't drive distracted, yet they still do, accidents happen every day. Just try to make sure you aren't on the giving end and hope that you aren't on the receiving.

42198,"Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered ""carfree"" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to ""Carfree Day"". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicle. The fights against pollution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and bogota, Colombia. And their efforts against pollution is really starting to take ahold and become popular.

In Vauban, Germany The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicle. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the ""experimental new district"". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000. Just for a parking lot.

Resulting factors from this CarFree suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicle. vaughn's residents seem to rather enjoy ""the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor."" Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called ""smart planning"". When finished in 2006 57 percent of it's residents sold their vehicle to move into the residence.

Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in lowcarcarless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstatehighway.

Even though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New Yorkian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950's. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vaubanlike.

In Paris, France Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it's residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with evennumbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31 in American currency. The same ensued for those with oddnumbered plates the next day.

Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicle for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67% of all vehicle in France.

Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicle the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plugin cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for oddnumbered plates a few days later.

In bogota Colombia Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring carfree day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to carfree day, all violators would be fined 25. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city.

Despite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to bogota to see the carfree event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders.

This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990's. bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this carfree day.

Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down pollution and smog levels.

The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cashstapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicle and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.

Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to ""rebrand"" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 1639 getting a license. Most people are turning to carpooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.

Many countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against pollution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans.

20437,"The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and reallistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the all-or-nothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.

When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccouted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notecard that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue ""Enter"" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?

The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 7-11 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, ""That girl Suzie's"" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an all-or-nothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 1700-1800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.

1065,"Cell Phones and Driving: A Potentially Fatal Combination

Cell phones are a staple in many people's lives today. It is a convenient and straightforward way to communicate with someone, gain knowledge, and directly search for information and use for different types of entertainment and media. Everywhere you go, you can see a phone on someone's person, and sometimes even on the road. This single action of holding a phone in your hand on the road has a heated debate going on around it. Should this be permitted or not? Let's look at the statistics-- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA 2019) reported 3,166 deaths that occurred in 2017 due to visually distracted driving. That makes up 8.5% of the total fatalities that year (FCC 2019). While this is still less than ten percent, we can make that number a lot lower and spare hundreds of lives each year. These deaths are avoidable.

The utilization of cell phones in a vehicle while operating should be prohibited in all states by legislation, nationally. Such prohibition includes messaging and all media; however, navigation programs on the phone could have several legal compromises and adjustments.

As mentioned previously, 8.5% of the annual fatalities in 2017 were caused by distracted driving. In addition to this information, The CDC states, ""Each day in the United States, approximately nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver."" (CDC). This is a massive amount of injuries each that could be easily avoided and possibly save many lives. Edgar Snyder and Associates, a personal injury law firm, publishes that ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving"" in the nation and 21 percent of teenagers behind the wheel that died in crashes were diverted by phones (Edgar Snyder and Associates). Texting is while driving is the most hazardous activity that can be done while operating a vehicle. ""Texting can make vehicle accidents 23 times more likely to happen."" (Helbock 2018). Looking at a phone while typing a message impairs the visual, cognitive, and manual abilities needed to efficiently and safely drive a car. While sending or replying to a text, a person is no longer only thinking about the road, but also taking in information and visuals on the phone. They are distracted from lights, signs, signals from other cars, and the entire road overall. Additionally, both hands are not on the steering wheel, weakening their control and regulation of the vehicle.

All of these disturbances, individually and combined, are exceedingly dangerous. When a person that is driving is using a mobile device, it not only imperils their own life but also the lives of passengers that may be in the vehicle with them, pedestrians, and other road users such as motorists and cyclists. In these kinds of accidents, many are either killed, injured, and many are frequently left disabled in various ways. However, phone use for travel navigation is a complex debate distinct from texting.

Numerous drivers use navigation applications installed on their phones and acknowledge that they are more efficient than the ones that may come in the system within their vehicles. However, not all are using them safely- having their phones in their lap, or next to them in a cupholder while looking at directions. They do this while also trying to pay attention to the road, but this is no better than not paying attention to the road entirely. Even if a person is not typing, the dilemma yet lies in not having eyes on the road. Looking down even for a few seconds to follow the navigation route is extremely dangerous. To this problem, the solutions are phone stands added with audio navigation guides. A sturdy phone stand should be fixed to the front windshield of the car from the inside a touch lower than eye level, so a person can still see the road ahead and their directions. In addition to this, an audio guide can play to direct them with ease while still having a visual guide at their convenience that will have a significantly lesser probability of inducing a fatal accident.

The best ways to prevent these accidents are with laws and education. Teaching young adults early in school is essential to have them remember the lessons later in life. The education system should take charge of incorporating lessons on road safety and phone use each year of a student's educational career to help them recognize the danger they could put themselves in when driving and looking at a phone in their hands. The earlier they start, the more educated they would be, and the less likely they would be to make the wrong decision later in life. After a student has graduated, strict road laws on phones and driving should be a regular reminder of their education, and not to put themselves and other people at risk. Legislation should be passed in every state regarding phone use in the car and make it reach out to citizens effectively. This would significantly reduce the number of vehicle fatalities each year.

While cell phones are utilized everywhere throughout our everyday lives, people should not use them while operating a vehicle. Various statistics show that this is an extremely practice that claims a multitude of lives every day, yet people continue to do so. Through education and legislation, the fatal numbers could be reduced, and citizens would be more educated on road laws and safety for themselves, including those around them, and make the streets safer for everyone. It is time to take this data more seriously and prohibit cell phone use on the roads.

42172,"The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and realistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the allornothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.

When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccounted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notepad that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, receipt, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue ""Enter"" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?

The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 711 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, ""That girl Suzie's"" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an allornothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California 55, Texas 38, and Florida 29, while smaller states get less, such as Alaska 3, Rhode Island 3, and Hawaii 4. Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 17001800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.",135,25,0.6875,0.2015,0.9694,0.4506,0.568,27.6042,559,637,"[1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 7, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 5, 0, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]",10,4.1977
12569,"Hi my name is PROPER_NAME and I work for NASA discussing with someone who thinks that the face was created by aliens but I said ""Well it couldn't be created by aliens because we all know is that aliens are not real"" and so I am still trying to figure out how this face has been created.

When I saw the pictures from 1976 to 2001 I saw one of the pictures and the picture from 1998 it looks like that something has hit the face and causing it to destroy it and to me it looks like a metor hit the face and in 2001 the face looks like its fading away and in 1976 it looks like it was popping out but when a metor hit it its goes away.

""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photoraping Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept.1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended.""

1406,"Today in the world, are you happy? Happy with how the world is growing up and acting or ashamed on how it is pleading to those who live in it to finally change for the better which isn't happening. Yet some children of mother nature or of the universe do believe that only living off of the non-materialistic ideas in life can help you get farther. However many people take pride in indulging on the sins that used excessively can't get them out of the hole they were forced into. Sterotypical people who contradict themseleves or those whom tend to be hypocrytes for that they don't understand always fail to stand for the better. I believe, that in all honesty, no one should be happy with the location of where they stand in society. Due to how far technology has gotten not even within the past two centuries, it must be stopped as a whole. Now let's actually discuss our main objective to throw out the window. The topic to fully dive into, based upon facts and personal opinions, Can stopping the mechanical reproduction of automobiles truly help the world out?

Just think about it, what are the possibilies that are being entitled within this topic in particular; but most importantly is there any way the upcoming generations can switch everything or everyone around, to change the mindset of all of the billions of people living on the planet to make it up for the better since we all know the way we are heading is not the place we should go? How fast or slow can this idea be put into place? The world we now know is indeed needing to be resureccted based alone on how much harm we have caused within the past few centuries. If you rely on technology too much doesnt that hurt yourself even more in the long run? Strategies or new found plans should be taken into consideration based on the facts presented and dismissed in the past because the way we are living and teaching those those who are newly born, should know that the world around them isn't right anymore, and direly needs help to improve. The society we are now dealing with, needs to play a new game or the world will end in more corruption than originally thought would happen. In all, isn't it good sometimes, to think about what is wrong and what you could do to help out? Now just sit and think to see where your own mind could lead you. Down the path were the world is once again healthy and happy? Or the path of destruction?

The path of destruction can lead to many implications based on health, or survival of the fittest, based on social status or skills gained in a hard cold world mostly dependent on how or when you grew up, due to how society changes over time. Scientists know based on their own work that the atmosphere can only handle so much pollution until it gives out and the world as we do know, learn, and live with can die. Do you want to see the slow demise of where you live, the place where is the only home known to man of the human species? Seeing death upon the streets due to failing natural health means, does it not actually hurt the heart to see such things? Plus car's do take too much space needed for other necesisties such as more room or storage to live a basic daily life in. Yes we may have the technology to fix natural things artificially but does it make it right to think that it will work? Cars cause pollution, pollution cases for health issues, health issues lead to over crowding at the hospital with disease, work load increases and those who work will tire and then eventually get sick themselves for which the most able to achieve end for this ongoing process could be death. Now do you understand where I might be getting at? Being sick mentally or physically is just the first step into a change in mind where all can go to hell and break loose or done in a good way, could change the future generations to restart where we all began. This is all just the basics of the wrong path imagine what could happen if nothing is done to stop the hurting and resume the healing.

Although that is the begining of an era that could happen due to stupidity or greed could you do us all a favor and imagine a realistic dream of what could happen if we dropped technology as a whole? All the metals could be recycled for greater purposes! Cars will lead us to see a whole new or happier society where socializing could be the end of all problems. Our health will be in tip top shape, everyone will finally understand what it could mean to live in harmony. Money not spent on transportation could be saved for greater purposes similar to expenses for your child's college maybe even for the advancement of useful environmentally friendly sciences to be learned or help funded or whichever other purpose you can think of. Yes one bad point is that many jobs could be lost but there is always back up plans that you could create for the worst case scenario. However, otherwise society will be happy and health issues should decrease if many of us chose to instead walk or use a bicycle to our destination, so isnt that a better dream to dream? ""Keep Moving forward"" as stated by Walter Disney, can that dream not be achieved by any means to increase the chances of a world where anything is possible to demand or chase after? Failure doesnt mean to give up but to rather keep trying to improve the ratio of failing to succeding. Cars may be important now, but in an alternate universe, what if they were never invented?

In conclusion these familes who are giving up their main source of transportation unless required, they are doing the right thing by taking the first step into a new way of life. Giving up cars is giving up the chance to accidentally hurt those by made a bad desicion. Althought depleting these choices of actions will or should decrease if this topic remains to be included as a new trend for a lack of better word majorly helpful to whose with crime records of the possibility of earning. Fighting with reason is better than to not fight at all. If your standing and doing nothing to help the environment around you, then don't you think you should consider the consequences for future generations down the road? Consider both sides of the argument, which is right or which is wrong to proceed with? The happier life versus the hurting of the world? I can only do nothing but act upon myself to show that what is going on is a coincidence merely to the fact that you are here reading my words. Can my words help from afar or not at all can only be determined by yourself.

So be wise and consider, do you chose left for healing or right for hurting?                            ",186,46,0.6034,0.3286,0.9825,0.4564,0.5756,26.6939,570,622,"[2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 7, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2]",19,4.1063
992,"While almost everyone owns and uses a mobile device, using them while behind the wheel of a vehicle should be prohibited.

While mobile devices are useful in everyday life, they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved. Devices cause distractions that can put not only the driver of the vehicle at risk but also those inside the vehicles, and the people all around the car. Distracted driving is one of the most dangerous types of driving and according to Edger Snyder & Associates, ""the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes every year"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates ""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving""). The sheer amount of crashes involving the use of mobile devices is shocking, and this is one of the main reasons that the use of any kind of device should be not allowed while behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Although a crash may not seem that bad, some of these crashes result in many deaths and injuries. In a 2018 study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it states that distracted driving claims over 2,841 lives (Andrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov 2020). These numbers represent not only the drivers, but also include their passengers and any pedestrians who have died as a result of the negligence and recklessness of drivers distracted by mobile devices. The dangers that distracted drivers place not only themselves but also those around them is completely unnecessary. The dangers not only lie on the road but they also extend to after the crash takes place.

One of the other major issues that distracted drivers face is the financial costs incurred after the initial wreck. The people that suffer the most financial damage are the drivers, followed by their passengers, and then pedestrians involved in the accident. Some reason drivers suffer the most is because they are left paying for the damages to the cars and for personal injuries, not to mention their insurance premiums potentially increase. The passengers and pedestrians suffer because of bodily injuries and potential long term recuperation. While they likely do not have to pay for vehicle damages, if severe enough, injuries prevent them from performing their day to day activities and work functions, which may leave them unable to work and without money to survive. The law office of Tavss Fletcher states that ""the average cost for each death in a motor vehicle accident is $1,130,000"" and ""each nonfatal disabling injury is $61,600"" (""The Price Paid for Automobile Accidents and Injuries""). So the cost for the accident far outweighs the risk of texting or calling while they are driving, not to mention the potential risk of injury not only for themself but for everyone involved in the accident.

On top of the financial and physical pain these types of accidents cause, there is also the emotional pain of the victims and the victim's families. When a victim survives and they are injured, they can't immediately go back to work, school, or their normal lives. They need to go to physical rehabilitation which causes strain on everyone involved. Along with this, there are mental disorders that develop after the crash, one of which is depression. According to the Myers Law Firm ""Some physical injuries limit victims' ability to work, exercise, and enjoy day-to-day activities like playing with their children. If you're suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it's no surprise you may become depressed"" (Myers Law Firm 2020). The victims may have difficulty adjusting to a new ""normal"" caused by injuries. These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities. Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish. Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult. Often time people involved in wrecks will have flashbacks about it, sometimes triggered by being in a car, being near the wreck site or something completely unrelated. Not only is the physical and financial cost of such an accident steep, but the mental toll has a hefty cost.

Aside from the mental, physical, and financial sides of the argument there is also the legal side of it. Many states are starting to realize the dangers of distracted driving and are prohibiting it, and if anyone is caught they will either be fined or sentenced to serve in jail for a short time. One example of a state that has made using a mobile device while behind the wheel of a vehicle is Georgia. The hands-free law states that ""A driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone...A driver may not write, send or read any text messages, e-mails, social media or internet data content""(""Hands-Free Law""). The states understand that the use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is dangerous, and they are starting to enforce that they need to get it under control.

The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited.

9828,"Could this be a total fail? Should we be able to let schools use this device? Could the machine be a waist of time? Should the info provided by the machine lead to somting bigger than just emotions? This divce could either help people or desroy people in its own way: or it could also be a complete fail.

The use of this device in class rooms would be great in a way;so the teachers could see whats going on with one of there students. On a total other note not every one can express there feelings through facial expresions; even some people tend to portray others emotional states wich leads to imataion. So personally I would not want to have this at my school. For there will be a complete disaster (people can always fake ).

In the text the writer was talking about ""empathy (the feeling of someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate other persons facial expreions'(found in paragraph 9).Another example from the text would be we dont neccacerly need a machine to predict others emotuions. In the text it stated that to an expert faces dont lie ;that muscles are a clue .Also that a false smile can be predicted by the facial mucles: in the text it stated that ""the mouth is stretched side ways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risourius"".

In conclusion the machine would not be valuable in a class room. There are many other things to focus on/in class that using the machine would be a complete waist of time. A way students could be checked on instead is by communicting with them or directing them in the correct direction.

12476,"The face is fake. there is a lot of evadence that the face is fake. for one,in all three pictures it looks different. also the"" face"" it not even simular to a face. it also says that the camra had to look close to get a pic.

Also another reasion I think that it is fake is because it says that the face looked like an egyotian pharaoh and it has no resemblence what so ever.

I also think tghat maby the face was made by somone from earth so that thay could make people beleve that there are ailens and that thay are probaly were verrry upset because thay thought that ailens were real and that thay were dangerions.

in the paragraph it says that there spacecraft was circling the earth and that they got photos, i dont think that is true because thay also said that thay were trying to havew it get better pics because it was all cloudy. I think that if it was cloudy than thay would not have as good as picturs.

I also think that thay are verry unedicated about the alian subject and that thay think thay are real and even might say that thay dont have any proof. the proof might scare people so much thay might beleve them and thay actully will care abouth if thay are righy.

19562,"The presidental elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to live. Not many people are well informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren't actually voting for the President but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senater. Many people agree with the Electorial Collage and many people don't. However my personal belief is that you should not support the Electorial Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and who's running the country as well as the fact that many people voted for the Electorial Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jepordize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system.

To begin with, the first reason I don't think you should support the Electorial Collage is because the system is unfair and it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campains and the candidates go give speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says "" If you lived in Texas, for inatance, and wanted to vote for (John) Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirty-four electoral votes. Who are the electors?"" amd in source 1 it says ""THe fouding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise."" But honest is it really a comprimise is you're not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the fait of our country up to hope and up to people that don't really know what their voting for. This is not fair and it doesn't live up to American values.

Another reason that you shouldn't support the Electorial Collage is because many of the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jepordize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidental elections you can't, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Even go as far as rigging election votes so they can win. in source two it states that ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn't right. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This isn't fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don't have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it's not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves.

The final reason that you shouldn't approve or support the Electorial System is because of the ""Winners take all"" system. In this system candidates really don't bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who vote for them are making a blind vote without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Goverment, and ect. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. You need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicans as it is why make it worse? ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all."" This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote.

However even in the midst of all that wrong with Electorial System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed but actually you don't know. Politicans are very secrative and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that's even a lie. We don't know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance?

To reiterate the bottom line is that these Electorial Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the ""Winner takes all system."" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.

We don't know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance?

To reiterate the bottom line is that these electoral Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the ""Winner takes all system."" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.",179,25,0.7549,0.2791,0.9801,0.4543,0.5738,20.3281,539,648,"[1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",19,4.1445
1746,"Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone woukd have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about saftey because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce alot of problems we have, and stress.

To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amout of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say ""So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!"" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.

Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say ""We can also just stop teens from driving.."" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amout of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be alot safer for people to drive. Sadly in alot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 3-4 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amout of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amout of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.

We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 10-20 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.

To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce alot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned alot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything.

43070,"Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone would have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about safety because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce lot of problems we have, and stress.

To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amount of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say ""So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!"" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.

Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say ""We can also just stop teens from driving.."" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amount of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be lot safer for people to drive. Sadly in lot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 34 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amount of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amount of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.

We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 1020 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.

To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce lot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned lot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything.",129,42,0.5088,0.2206,0.9673,0.444,0.5645,19.3714,549,682,"[2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 0, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]",36,3.8827
8208,"Imagine being convinced that completing a certain task is worth any strugles along the way, and you end up severely hurt because of it. That is exaclty what the author of this article is trying to do. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author does a poor job of supporting the idea that studying a planet as dangerous as Venus is worth it. Studying Venus is a terrible idea because technology isn't advanced enough, it would take years to discover anything beneficial, and the costs' of this, both in money and lives, are outrageous.

Technology throughout the world has improved since the 1900's,however, it has improved on Earth and in regards to Earthly tasks. When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion"". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but ""survivable"". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.

Exploring unmarked territory isn't something that can be done over night. Unmarked territory is exactly what Venus is. Even if technology did evolve enough so that humans could visit this planet, it would takes years, decades, even centuries, to accomplish. In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving ""what if"" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, ""Is it worth the wait?"". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.

Assuming that the exploration of Venus does eventually happen one day, how much money would go into it, how many lives? These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, "" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.

In conclusion, since our technology isn't advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously. Exploring Venus proves to be a terrible idea, atleast until we are actually ready to do it.

2044,"Have you ever seen a smog cloud before? Or even been a city that has a really high level of it? It's typically caused by the vehicles, and how much that they're used in the area that you happened to be in. There are some places that have days where your not aloud to drive. There are some places that people don't even own cars, and places where people only go by bus, bike, car pooling, or train. But there is one thing we notice about all of these people, and the places that they live in when they have people consistently going by other means, and not using their car. It's been a problem that has been up in the air for the longest time, and people are starting to do something about it, and probably without even knowing it.

The city of Vauban, Germany is pretty normal. it consist of normal homes, normal people, and just normal everyday life. Except for two things. ""Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free""-except the main throughfare"" (Parragraph 2, Source 1). Even if you owned a car, ""there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of teh development, where a car-owner buys a space, for fourty-thousand dollars, along with a home"" (Parragraph 2, Source 1). The other crazy thing about this town is that Vauban is ""home to five thousand-five hundred residents within a rectangular square mile

"" (Parragraph 6, Source 1). Their town is free of the green house emissions that are caused by passanger cars. It's there way of smart planning, and other cities are starting to try to find ways to become cleaner, and better at being somehow like Vauban. People here say that it reduces the stress of driving, and traffic jams, and makes life simply easier by not driving. But imagine if you were banned from driving in a place where you were used to driving everyday.

Paris decided that ""after days of near-record pollution, they would enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Parragraph 10, Source 2). some 4,000 drivers were given a fine of thirty-one dollars, and there were twenty-seven cars impounded due to disobeying the ban. however, after 5 days of this ban going in to effect, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of france"" (Parragraph 14, Source 2). The people driving isn't really the problem, it's the fact that ""France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline"" (Parragraph 16, Source 2) and they're saying that becuase it makes up such a higher percentage of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that it's causing their smog levels to go up higher as well. Gradually the smog lifted off of the city of paris, and they were finally able to start letting certain amounts of cars back on the road without fines. There are some places that they have days that are car free?

In the Latin-American city of Bogota, they have a day that's car-free. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work"" (Parragraph 20, Source 3). They only face a small fine of twenty-five bucks if they decide to drive, but msot people don't have to worry if they don't have a bike or don't want to walk. Buses and taxis are still aloud on the roads. Even on the days where ""gray clouds dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota, the rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" Parragraph 22-23, Source 3). It's not just 5,500 people who don't do it, there are seven million people in the capital city who don't drive. It's been going on since the 1990s. The city has planned, and made efforts to have these days so that they can also take part in the reductin of the emiisions of green house gases. ""The city has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths; and uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth ones"" (Parragraph 27-28, Source 3). Many places are trying to encorporate designs in to their cities to do these things, and to become better at traveling in means other than your personal vehicle. but even without our knowledge, people are starting to limit car usage without being told to, it's just inch by inch.

People are beggingin to drive less, and ""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"" (Parragraph 32, Source 4. however in the past few years, americans have bught fewer cars, and ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has dropped steadily therafter"" (Parragraph 32, Source 4). reseachers are intrigued that car ownership per household had gone down,  three to four years before they noticed this. This pattern continuing, which they believe it will, would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"" (Parragraph 34, Source 4). Other odd things have changed too. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of sixteen to thirty-nine year olds gettign a license. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased twenty-three percent between 2001-2009"" (Parragraph 41, Source 4). Plans are being put in action to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and to put more ways into cities for people to travel alternatively to their normal going by car. The way that we're building cities, new suburbs, and things like that are beginning to incorporate other ideas from around the world to help not just everyone including yourself, but also the enviroment itself.

Meeting new people really isn't all that bad, and traveling by bus, train, transit, taxi, car pooling, bicycling, tram, trolley, walking, skating or even the interesting inventions we see by people all the time. There are many different ways that you can avoid having to drive your own car. It isn't a hassle. It's also a stress reliever, and helps you not get worried about how your going to avoid that five o'clock rush hour traffic jam that you have to sit and yell at people in. Not only does it probably save you money not having to buy gas every couple of days, it also helps you and the enviroment. Breathing cleaner air helps you to live longer than breathing air that has all that smog, and nastiness in the air. Your city is only a step in a new direction, and it's only a matter of how you want to do it. There's optoins, like you hear in the insruance commercials, that you can take and be just fine.

777,"Cell Phones are now seen as an essential item for millions of people. Throughout each day people need to use their phones for multiple reasons including, communicating with family members, answering phone calls from work, or using the GPS to drive to the nearest McDonalds. Smartphones make life simpler and even safer, but that is not always the case. Most people lack the discipline to peel away from their phone when put in situations where multitasking is not a good idea. For example, while driving the steering wheel needs all of your attention because a simple glance at your phone trying to text back your mom could cause a fatal accident. It is evident that texting while driving should be banned or at least states should be willing to put major restrictions to reduce the dangerous outcomes from using an electronic device while driving a vehicle. People should not be allowed to use their cell phones at any time while driving a vehicle because they are putting themselves at a higher risk to crash, cellsphones reduce the drivers ability to maintain focus, and phones are the leading cause of accidents in the highway.

People should not be allowed to use their cellphones while driving at any time due to the fact that it increases the likelihood of a car wreck. It is true, people all over the world are super busy and never enough time to get things done so they try to multitask. This leaves them to get things done while on the road. Most Americans are addicted to their phone as well and check their phone more times then needed while driving. According to a study made last year, ""People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into an accident than those who drive while intoxicated."" While this may seem crazy, something illegal such as drinking and driving is less dangerous than texting and driving but, it is a fact that cannot be ignored. Even though millions are told to not text and drive they continue to ignore the deadly warnings from participating in cellphone use while operating a vehicle yet once again making the wrong choice. Always remember that texting or using a cellphone while driving is extremely risky not only for yourself but for those in your car as well as vehicles around you.

In 2009, 5,474 lives were taken and 448,000 people got injured from car accidents from being distracted while driving, as stated by the government. The lives of innocent people are being taken every day because of a simple distraction. Car crashes are four times more common to take place while the driver is on their phones over any other causes. Different states have views on the laws that are being used about texting while driving. Utah has a law established stating that if a driver is texting while driving and crashes they will spend fifteen years in jail. Most people don't seem to realize how careless they can be while driving a car. Talking on a cell phone is not as dangerous as texting these days. While talking on the phone, it is easier to still keep focused on the road in front of the driver. When they look at their text messages, it's not possible to look in both directions at once, therefore all of their focus goes straight to the screen of the cell phone. The article ""10 Terryfying facts about texting and driving'' by Drivers Alert states, ""11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway."" It's hard for all drivers, especially teenagers, to put down the cell phone and put their hands on the wheel, which results in many car crashes. That means the carelessness of any driver could end their life in seconds or even worse cause the death of others. While driving, the driver's main focus should never be their phone; it should be getting to their destination safely.

Texting and driving is the leading cause of crashes on the road. Most would imagine that it would be reckless driving by intoxicated people but that is not true. As stated previously, only 11 teenagers die every day due to the use of cellphones while driving and that doesnt even include adults or other bystanders. Hence, the reason why most states and countries have declared cellphone use while driving illegal. Unfortunately, the rate of crashes caused by cell phone use has only gone down 4%. Furthermore, did you know that 1 out of 4 people die from crashes that are involved with cellular device usage. Most of you would agree that you are a good driver and that texting does not impact your driving skills, but statistics show otherwise. Imagine a scenario, where you are driving and receive a text from your mother and all you have to do is respond yes or no. Studies have shown that it takes a person at least 5 seconds to reply. If you were going 55 miles per hour that's like driving half a the length of a football field. Anything could happen in those 5 seconds and this is probably the case in most crashes every single day making this one of the leading causes in the world.

There is no question, vehicles and cell phones both are definitely important objects in every person's life. Sometimes people even use both at the same time just because they can without thinking about the consequences. Bad things will always come from cellphone usage while operating a vehicle. No matter how many laws are placed, tools made to lessen the contact between you and your phone the only actual way to not allow your phone to distract you is to put it away. It is understandable, if there is an emergency and you need to pick up the phone but, if it's just a text from your mom with no urgency all you have to do is simply wait. It only takes considering the possibilities of terrible things that can happen by choosing to prioritize your safety as well as others. It is never too hard to practice using your phone less while driving, and most importantly if you have children or teens who see you on your phone while driving they might think it's okay to do it as well. In that case you might not crash that day, but in the future your kids who saw you do it choose to do it as well. There are various ways and solutions to make cell phone usage close to none, use them to keep yourself safe. So, next time your phone rings, make sure to send the right message by not sending that text.

1048,"Phones & Driving

Billions of people throughout the world are using cell phones in daily routine life. Cell phones provide communication with greater flexibility. It is, nowadays considered less fashion and more a utility providing several benefits. Cell phones have different features in addition to communication including cameras, video games, music, FM receivers etc. Cell phones not only facilitate business and personal convenience they also provide comfort and safety. However, observations, experience, and studies all have highlighted the dangerous effects of using cell phones during driving, strictly unadvisable, and an illegal matter. The major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts attention of driver. (Scotti, 2007)

There are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention. They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating at the same time that increases threats to safety. Furthermore, drivers has also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance. (Gravelle, 2005)

Despite offering huge benefits, cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers using cell phones are not able to give their complete attention on roads exposing not only themselves but also other people on the road. Therefore, most of the governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Greece, Germany, and different Asian as well as African countries, have imposed restriction on using cell phones during driving.

Because of diversion in attention drivers reacts slowly to the traffic signals, missing them at times. Decision making during driving is a critical factor giving drivers fraction of a second to make a swift decision about a given complex scenario. Studies have highlighted those drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decision causing serious accidents involving other vehicles also. (Gravelle, 2005)

Drivers demonstrates comparatively slower braking responses and also had low awareness of other traffic flowing through the roads ignoring their presence concentrating more on cell phones and less on roads as how other drivers are behaving. Different studies have reported hundreds of deaths during a year because of using cell phones during driving.

Increased Chances of Fatal Accidents

Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. (Gravelle, 2005)

The main advantage to avoid using cell phone during driving is ensuring safety of driver, vehicle, and other people driving on the road. By making conversation, writing messages, or just playing with the mobile increases the chances of accidents. It is pertinent to highlight that hands-free phones have also similar negative impacts during driving; both distracts attention, although hands-free cell phones do not require manual handling. (Sturnguist, 2006)

The nature of conversation on cell phones during driving differs and can have distinctive impacts on drivers. The complexity of conversation draws more attention of drivers, while simple or casual conversation is less distracting, however, both may produce same consequences. As such, the more complex a situation is higher are chances of distraction that presents a threat to road safety. (Klein, 2000)

Cell phone users while driving has low level of perceptions. There exists a direct relationship between perception and performance of a driver. Distracted attention results in low perception of the driver reducing performance levels. A major strength of driving skills is a pro-active approach anticipating actions of other drivers and making adjustments accordingly. However, a driver busy in conversation on a cell phone is unable to adopt a pro-active approach and it becomes almost impossible to anticipate other person's attitude as well as behavior. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death. (Gravelle, 2005)

Some Benefits of Cell Phones during Driving

Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic. (Sturnguist, 2006)

Conclusion

The paper has presented arguments on both sides of the issue using or not using cell phones during driving. On the basis of arguments presented in the paper, it can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

Generic_Name asked Generic_Name and Generic_Name, ""Sure we'll go ask her"",they walked towards Generic_Name, ""Hey Generic_Name"" Generic_Name said, ""how have you've been?"" ""Awful"", Generic_Name answered. Generic_Name glanced at Generic_Name, ""Oh why is that?'' Generic_Name finally asked, ""Generic_Name isn't taking me to Florida, and instead is taking Generic_Name when in reality Generic_Name and I have been planning on going to Florida since forever!"" Generic_Name exclaimed. ""Oh is this why you've been ignoring her?"" Generic_Name asked while sitting besides Generic_Name, ""Yes and it seems as if she doesn't even care"", Generic_Name answered. ""Well maybe it's because you've been ignoring her, in reality she doesn't know what she did wrong, instead of ignoring her you should talk it out with her"",Generic_Name advised Generic_Name, the two girls got up and went back where Generic_Name was, while Generic_Name sat there she realized that she was the one who messed up. Instead of ignoring Generic_Name she should've discussed the situation with her, she realized that Generic_Name's advice wasn't the best and she should've went to more people for advice. It is best when you ask multiple people for advice rather than only asking one because it gives you multiple choices, same situations, and an overview on the situation

First off, a benefit in asking multiple people for advice is them giving you a variety of choices to pick from. For instance, Generic_Name had snuck out and while he was out having a fun time, he fell from a high distance and broke his arm. He had to come up with a way to tell his parents without telling them what really happened so he went to his friends for advice, they gave him various situations now he could now choose because he knew that if one didn't work the other one had too. This is useful because if he had just asked one of his friends their plan could've backfired. Another example, Generic_Name didn't want to go out, so she asked her friends what to do so she could convince her parents not to take her out. Her friends came up with a bunch of ideas,now she could do all of them until her parents let her stay home. Unlike if she would've asked one person, and they reply with say you don't feel good her parents still would've taken her because it isn't creative as the others. So when asking more people for advice it gives you multiple options to choose from.

Next, asking multiple people lets you find others that have gone through the same situation as you and figure what is best to do. For example, Generic_Name had just gotten into an argument with her friend and didn't know what to do, when she asked her friend Generic_Name for advice she told her that she had once gotten into an argument with the same person as Generic_Name so she let her know what to do. With that advice Generic_Name's problem was now solved. Another case, in where this happened is when Generic_Name got dumped by her boyfriend she was overcome with sadness, but she didn't want to stay like this she knew a lot of her friends had been through this exact situation she went to them for advice they gave her amazing advice that helped her overcome her dilemma. Now if she had gone with someone that hadn't gone through a breakup their advice wouldn't have been as effective. So going for multiple people for advice lets you meet people that have gone through the same situation.

Finally, when going to multiple people for advice they will most often give you the same ideas and it gives you an overview of what you need to do, especially if you're not controlled at the time you won't do anything you shouldn't. For instance, Generic_Name had found out her friend had been telling everyone secrets Generic_Name trusted her with. She went to go ask for advice and everyone had maintained the concept of talking to her and trying to resolve what had happened. Even though she was furious at how her friend had done that to her she didn't go around doing the same thing she had done to her because her outlook on this situation was trying to resolve the problem. Another time, is when Generic_Name was failing one of his classes and he had a big test that would count as half of his grade he didn't know what to do because if he failed this test he was definitely going to fail this class. Going to ask his friends they told him to study and get help from his teacher, so that is what he did instead of cheating since at the time it felt like the only way to get out of this problem but now his overlook on this situation was studying and getting help on what he needed to get better at to pass his test. So when asking multiple people for advice it gives you an overview on the sitution and helps you control yourself.

Generic_Name went to go ask her friends on what to do with Generic_Name, as she had found out she was taking Generic_Name with her to Florida instead of her which had been the original plan. ""Talk to her and check if she is actually taking Generic_Name before anything"", Generic_Name said. ""Don't do anything you'll regret later so just try to resolve it"", Generic_Name said, everyone she had asked kept the same concept of making sure she was taking Generic_Name and talking to her and trying to resolve the problem. Generic_Name resolved it,that's why taking advice from multiple people is best.       ",112,25,0.635,0.203,0.9639,0.3634,0.5309,31.0732,440,584,"[0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5, 1, 5, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 2, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 5, 0, 1, 5, 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 5, 2, 5, 1, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 5, 2, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 5, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 5, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 5, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1]",7,4.1578
42534,"Have you ever seen a smog cloud before? Or even been a city that has a really high level of it? It's typically caused by the vehicles, and how much that they're used in the area that you happened to be in. There are some places that have days where your not aloud to drive. There are some places that people don't even own cars, and places where people only go by bus, bike, car pooling, or train. But there is one thing we notice about all of these people, and the places that they live in when they have people consistently going by other means, and not using their car. It's been a problem that has been up in the air for the longest time, and people are starting to do something about it, and probably without even knowing it.

The city of Vauban, Germany is pretty normal. it consist of normal homes, normal people, and just normal everyday life. Except for two things. ""vaughn's streets are completely ""carfree""except the main thoroughfare"" paragraph 2, Source 1. Even if you owned a car, ""there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for fortythousand dollars, along with a home"" paragraph 2, Source 1. The other crazy thing about this town is that Vauban is ""home to five thousandfive hundred residents within a rectangular square mile "" paragraph 6, Source 1. Their town is free of the green house emissions that are caused by passanger cars. It's there way of smart planning, and other cities are starting to try to find ways to become cleaner, and better at being somehow like Vauban. People here say that it reduces the stress of driving, and traffic jams, and makes life simply easier by not driving. But imagine if you were banned from driving in a place where you were used to driving everyday.

Paris decided that ""after days of nearrecord pollution, they would enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" paragraph 10, Source 2. some 4,000 drivers were given a fine of thirtyone dollars, and there were twentyseven cars impounded due to disobeying the ban. however, after 5 days of this ban going in to effect, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of france"" paragraph 14, Source 2. The people driving isn't really the problem, it's the fact that ""France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline"" paragraph 16, Source 2 and they're saying that becuase it makes up such a higher percentage of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that it's causing their smog levels to go up higher as well. Gradually the smog lifted off of the city of paris, and they were finally able to start letting certain amounts of cars back on the road without fines. There are some places that they have days that are car free?

In the LatinAmerican city of Bogota, they have a day that's carfree. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work"" paragraph 20, Source 3. They only face a small fine of twentyfive bucks if they decide to drive, but msot people don't have to worry if they don't have a bike or don't want to walk. Buses and taxis are still aloud on the roads. Even on the days where ""gray clouds dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota, the rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" paragraph 2223, Source 3. It's not just 5,500 people who don't do it, there are seven million people in the capital city who don't drive. It's been going on since the 1990s. The city has planned, and made efforts to have these days so that they can also take part in the reductin of the emiisions of green house gases. ""The city has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths and uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth ones"" paragraph 2728, Source 3. Many places are trying to encorporate designs in to their cities to do these things, and to become better at traveling in means other than your personal vehicle. but even without our knowledge, people are starting to limit car usage without being told to, it's just inch by inch.

People are beggingin to drive less, and ""America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"" paragraph 32, Source 4. however in the past few years, americans have bught fewer cars, and ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has dropped steadily therafter"" paragraph 32, Source 4. reseachers are intrigued that car ownership per household had gone down, three to four years before they noticed this. This pattern continuing, which they believe it will, would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"" paragraph 34, Source 4. Other odd things have changed too. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of sixteen to thirtynine year olds gettign a license. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased twentythree percent between 20012009"" paragraph 41, Source 4. Plans are being put in action to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and to put more ways into cities for people to travel alternatively to their normal going by car. The way that we're building cities, new suburbs, and things like that are beginning to incorporate other ideas from around the world to help not just everyone including yourself, but also the enviroment itself.

Meeting new people really isn't all that bad, and traveling by bus, train, transit, taxi, car pooling, bicycling, tram, trolley, walking, skating or even the interesting inventions we see by people all the time. There are many different ways that you can avoid having to drive your own car. It isn't a hassle. It's also a stress reliever, and helps you not get worried about how your going to avoid that five o'clock rush hour traffic jam that you have to sit and yell at people in. Not only does it probably save you money not having to buy gas every couple of days, it also helps you and the enviroment. Breathing cleaner air helps you to live longer than breathing air that has all that smog, and nastiness in the air. Your city is only a step in a new direction, and it's only a matter of how you want to do it. There's optoins, like you hear in the insruance commercials, that you can take and be just fine. There's a lot of advantages to the limiting of car uses, and the carfree days. It's just on you whether or not you want to take that route, make a change in your daily habit, and find that simple way to limit your car usage.",136,20,0.7436,0.1905,0.9685,0.4392,0.5631,26.5,549,689,"[2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 5, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 5, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3]",3,3.9781
1740,"For many years countries like the United States, France, and Germany idolized the cars that they managed to manufacture. This so-called ""love affair"" between people and their cars, though, has started to diminish, and it may be for the better. In the past, the people who owned the prettiest, loudest, and coolest cars considered themselves to be at the top of an automobile social structure, but now, new generations are starting to move away from buying cars. They've resorting to walking, bicycling, or taking a form of public transport. Sure, owning cars may make you ""better"" than everyone else, but at what cost?

Carbon dioxide emissions are at an all-time high, meaning that cars are harming the world more than helping it.

Yes, cars will be continue to be seen as cool, and owning cars will continue to be seen as cool, but nevertheless, with green house gases emitted from the tailpipes of cars ripping holes in the Earth's atmosphere, cars seem to be more of an impediment to the cause than an improvement.

Countries in Western Europe such as Paris and Germany have recognized that the exponential amounts of smog produced by cars are becoming dangerous. Legislators everywhere are taking cautious steps towards eliminating the gases that have a choke hold their cities. An official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg says ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" (Par. 7, Rosenthal). Cities in Paris and Germany are adopting a similar idea- developing cities than have a ban cars.

Vauban, Germany is one of these cities, dicouraging their 5,500 residents to give up their cars, charging them $40,000 to be able to park in one of the two garages in the city. As a result of these rules, 70% of the families that live in Vauban don't own a car, and 57% sold a car in order to live there (Par. 3, Rosenthal). The citizens are reported to be happier and less tense without a car, claiming that cars were the cause of their stress.

Communites like Vauban are set up in a way that makes life easy for the car-less citizens. In this approach, stores and offices are placed within walking distance from the houses, rather than in malls along some distant highway (Par. 6, Rosenthal). This has effectively reduced the amount of emissions of green-house gases drastically in Germany, and other countries around the world are starting to adopt Vauban's basic precepts in an attempt to make cities more compact (Par. 6, Rosenthal).

Paris, France is one of these cities that is revolutionizing its transportation. Paris has more smog than any other European counry, with 147 micrograms of particulate matter in the air, compared to 79.7 micrograms in London (Par. 17, Duffer). The smog rivaling that of Beijing, China, attempts were made by the government to reduce this smog, fining motorists for two days if they were found using their cars. France, having tax policies that favored the use of diesel over regular gas, blamed diesel fuel for it's record pollution levels.

Bogota, Colombia ran into a similar problem with it's high numbers of carbon dioxide emissions. The country has developed an atmosphere improvement campaign in the 1990's, constructing hiking and bicycle paths to encourage people to go ""car-free"". For the Day Without Cars, alternative transportation like taxis, buses, and bicycles are promoted, and violators that use their cars on this day are fined $25. Despite the constant rain, participants still turned out, claiming that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution,"" (Par. 24, Selsky).

Other cities in Colombia have joined the event such as Cali and Valledupar. The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, hearing about the revolutionary event says ""These people are genertaing a revolutionary change, anf this is crossing borders,"" (Par 26, Selsky). Since the Day Without Cars' institution, parks and sports centers have prospered, sidewalks and roads have been repaved, and traffic congestion has been dramatically reduced (Par. 28, Selsky). The appeal of car culture is decreasing, and it has effected countries all over the world.

An ""incipient shift"" in American's behavior over the last few years sugests that the American people are driving less, buying fewer cars, and getting fewer licenses every year (Par. 29, Rosenthal). The number of miles driven by Americans peaked in 2005, and has been diminishing steadily after that. Due to the recession, the majority of Americans couldn't afford to buy new cars, meaning that less people were driving.

Mimi Sheller, a sociology professer states that, ""Different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" (Par. 35, Rosenthal). What she says is true; carpooling, van and public transportation services, and bike-sharing programs are the most populat they've ever been. Shifts in the population of drivers may accelerate the current trend, and the ""cash-strapped"" Americans that can't afford a car may never actually have to buy one.

The teenage and young adult population has been affected by this cultural shift aswell, with many teenagers not bothering to get a liscence. They figure out other ways to get around, and revolve their schedules arounf where they can walk or which friend they can ride with. Driving by young people is at an all-time low, dropping by 23% between 2001 and 2009 (Par. 41, Rosenthal). Many young people are adopting the ideas that owning, or even driving vehicles is impractical, or even undesirable. This mind-set, in turn, is reducing green house gas emissions unintentionally.

Over the years car and culture trends have changed multiple times, and this trend occurring now is probably the best one yet. Reducing carbon dioxide and green house gas emissions is very important, and this current philosophy and outlook on cars is aiding the elimination of those harmful gases. ""Pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commecial and public traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" (Par. 43, Rosenthal).

698,"The Dangers of Texting and Driving

In today's time, we all want to stay connected to our family, friends, and loved ones, now even more than ever. With the boom in technology and smart phones, it is no surprise that just about everyone has one. With those advances, we are able to keep in touch and stay connected with everyone by calling, sending emails, using social media, and by texting. Even though it may be easy and convenient to stay connected, and even though there are many other positive effects of technology, there also comes many negative effects are there comes great dangers to include texting and driving. There are both positive and negative effects when driving as well, when adding texting and other distractions in while driving, the negative effects, and dangers are increased a lot more. Calling and texting while behind the wheel has become increasingly common for many drivers in today's society, and just as it can become common, it has led to many distractions, more accidents, and more fatalities.

One cardinal rule of driving has always been to keep both hands on the wheel. While driving, even with the car on cruise control, sometimes we forget how much of a risk we are taking as we are not only responsible for our car, we must stay protected and cautious of those around us as well. Even though we only think of the temporary satisfaction or benefit that we have from driving, we often don't think of how we put ourselves, other drivers, and pedestrians at risk. Driving requires a lot of focus and it requires our full and undivided attention. Texting and driving places you at risk because you are taking your eyes off the road, you are taking your hands off of the wheel, and evening more you are taking your mind off of driving. Distractions such as texting or even calling can cause some of the smallest or some of the most life threatening, life altering issues. It is no surprise that texting while driving takes your concentration off the road and with the distractions, even for a second, it could have consequences some minor, while others can bring on serious consequences. With just a second of texting, we can miss important signs or messages on the road, it can lead to speeding which can lead to very expensive tickets. In addition to speeding fines and tickets, distracted driving also leads to higher insurance premiums which add up to be a lot over time. To some, that risk may be minor, but another serious consequence for distracted driving is that it can lead to jail time. It does not matter how good of a driver you may think you are or how good your driving skills may be, unless you are capable of equally concentrating on multiple things at one time (which is not possible), you will be distracted when doing anything other than focusing on the road, and that places you and others at a serious risk.

Accidents on the road can happen and anytime and for a number of reasons, but it is no surprise that if texting and driving leads to more distractions, those distractions also leads to more accidents and more fatalities. Over the years, as technology has advanced and with more ways to stay connected, combined with people that refuse to make the right decision, the rates and statistics of texting related deaths have drastically increased. While checking messages and emails, making phone calls, or even sending the shortest message, so many things can go wrong. Just the slightest distraction can cause someone to run off the road causing them to run off the road, hit another car, or even hit a pedestrian, Those distractions combined with high speeds, a tiny click of the finger can cause many to be critically injured or it can cause someone to lose their life. According to Luke Ameen, 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United Stated are caused by texting and driving, 421,000 are injured in car crashed that have involved a driver who is distracted in some way, and 37,000 people die in auto accidents every year due to being distracted or texting while driving and those numbers are expected to increase over the years. Texting or reading a message takes your eyes off the road for a minimum of three seconds and within those short seconds someone can lose their lives or sustain life threatening injuries that they would have to live with for the rest of their lives. Even if all of those drivers are not at fault, they could have probably avoided the accident if they were not distracted by texting.

In an effort to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities caused by distracted drivers, people can take simple steps to help save lives. Although auto accidents take place every day and for a variety of reasons, distractions seem to cause more of a problem so if we limit or stop the distractions we can prevent accidents and help to save more people. While driving it is important for people to save the distractions for later. People have been encouraged to put their phones on silent or to turn them off, they can put their phones out of their reach such as in the glove compartment, back seat, or their trunks, or they can take other measures such as downloading apps that would prevent them from using the phone when it has been detected that their vehicles are in motion. While these are just a few things that can be done, people should do what is best for them. While these actions may seem extreme to some, saving their life or the lives of others is more important. Most states and insurance companies have also put policies and other actions in place that will assist with reducing the number of fatalities causes by texting or distracted driving. Most states have provided discounts for safe drivers while other states are issuing fines and some go to the extreme of jail time if drivers are caught texting or using their phones while driving. When driving, we are faced with enough dangers. Even though we want to stay connected to our friends, family, and loved ones, all it takes is a few seconds to never be able to get that opportunity again. While behind the wheels, taking simple actions can help save our life or the life of others. There are several options that we can take to cause an accident and just the same, there are several options that can be taken to prevent them from happening as well.

Limiting cars could possibly terminate childhood and adultheood obesity. It could also provide happiness and joy, and even willing exercise. Cars bothe hinder, and help us, it gets thee people where theey need to go, but it ruins thee environment and makes many people letheargic.

Withe thee limitation of cars comes thee major improvement on pollution.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in thee United States"" 1, Rosentheal. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 precent of thee greenhouse emissions found in Europe, and where most cars are used thee greenhouse gass emissions are up to 50 percent. The amount of gas theat is polluting thee air is asoultly hazardous to thee healthe of many people. ""...The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of thee most polluted cities in thee world"" 1, Duffer. Paris eventually needed to ban driving due to thee smog theat was being produced from thee cars. As stated in thee article, ""...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and thee environment, since transportation is thee second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" 1, Rosentheal. If we were to limit thee car usage, many smog and greehouse gases would not be as much of an issue as it is now. If we were to limit thee usage of cars and prefer to carpool, alot of gas, money, and lives. Withe thee limiting of car usage comes thee possibility of living a longer, healtheier life witheout pollution tearing a hole in thee ozone layer.

Limiting thee use of cars can also produce more activity among thee people and happiness. Limiting thee use of cars forces many people to start walking, using trains, running, and even bicycling. As states in thee article, ""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect theose new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across thee nations"" 1, Rosentheal. Many places are now starting to realize theat thee people are slowly loosing interest in cars and now perfer to walk, run, or even take public transportation. As stated in thee article, ""..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work leaving a carfree day yesterday, leaving thee streets of theis capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.... 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" 1, Selsky. ""It has seen thee construction of bicycle pathes, thee most of any Latin American cirt....Parks and sports centers also have bloomes theroughout thee city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smoothe sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" 1, Selsky. Many citizens are starting to prefer to walk ratheer thean drive. The people are slowly moving away from motor vehicles and are starting to go outside and to exercise. As mentioned in thee article, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier theis way,"" 1, Rosentheal This choice is making alot most people happy and satified. Many people no longer need to fret about gas money or traffic, or even about arriving on time. Having no car is a stressreliever theat saves you time, stress, and keeps you from pulling at your hair. Exercising is also a much easier way to be able to blow off steam and reduce stress.

Anotheer positive of limiting car use is thee safety theat is provided. Many Americans are now choosing to not recieve a license. The people are slowly moving away from thee driving of cars and are now preferring to use public transportation, or even walking. People are now slowly starting to center theeir lives around where it could be easy to transport. Their place of work could now be centered around where public transport is able to drop theem off, a walking distance, or even on thee normal route theat a friend, whom you could be able to catch a ride, wouldn't mind dropping you off at. As stated in thee article, ""They organize theeir summer jobs and social life around where theey can walk or take public transportation or carpool withe friends"" 1, Rosentheal. Anotheer reason why many people do not drive, is due to thee fact theat many families and people cannot afford a vehicle, or theey choose to not purchase one. As stated in thee artice, ""'What most intrigues me is theat rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to theree years before thee downturn"" 1, Rosentheal. Withe less amount of people on thee road, theis lowers thee possible chances of someone being in an accident. The possibility of poeple being in car accident have been lowered, because a majority of thee people are refusing to drive. As mentioned in an artice, ""When adjusted to thee population growthe, the enumber of miles driven in thee United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily theereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short...thee number of miles driven perperson was nearly 9 percent below thee peak and equal to where thee country was in January 1995"" 1, Rosentheal. If thee people were to drive less theis would mean less accidents and less pollution which could lead to lenghtier lives and to healtheier lives.

In conclusion, withe thee limitation on thee use of automobiles comes thee many possibilities theat could possibly save lives and reshape theem into sometheing much more healtheier. While reducing thee usage of automobiles comes exercise and thee relief os stress. Maybe childhood or adultheood obesity would not be as large of an issue if were reduced car usage. Many people could theen be healtheier and more involeved in theeir communities. Withe thee limitation of car usage comes thee unlimited possibilities.",159,31,0.6737,0.2179,0.9726,0.5346,0.6029,24.9792,610,759,"[1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 0, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5]",8,4.3661
2293,"Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save moeny. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minizie pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park"" (Rosenthal 2) but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. ""Car-owners can buy a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" (Rosenthal 2) That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article ""

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of Vauban's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a ""partial driving ban to clear the air or global city"" (Duffer 10). For example, in this article called ""

Paris bans driving due to smog

"" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be $31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about ""4,000 drivers were fined,"" and ""27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" (Duffer 12). Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" (Duffer 14). The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. ""

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota

"" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of ""7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" (Selsky 21) Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has ""118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City."" (Selsky 27) One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called ""

The End of Car Culture

"", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (Rosenthal 29) The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, ""Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" (Rosenthal 29). New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air (unless it's a hybrid). The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.            ",128,10,0.8551,0.1767,0.9727,0.4482,0.5684,20.8571,552,665,"[1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4]",1,3.8752
24739,"Generic_Name is having a test tomorrow and needs to get an one hundred percent so she can pass math class but she is having a extremely hard time understanding what ten plus ten is, she asks her dad the question, he says, ""Im not the best math teacher but i'm pretty sure ten plus ten is twenty one."" Generic_Name believes her dad, and reminds herself ten plus ten is twenty one. the next morning she wakes up and reminds herself to plus ten is twenty one and goes to school, she has math right as she goes to school, she took the test and it said she got a eighty nine percent. She was shocked and didnt know what to do, she looked at the one she got wrong and it was ten plus ten, she was even more surprised and told the teacher. The teacher said, ""The answer was twenty."" She failed math class all because of her dad making a silly mistake and because Generic_Name did not ask anyone else. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see if it is truly the right answer, in case the first person that looked at it did it wrong, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at.

First off, you can see if it is truly the right answer. For example, Generic_Name has science homework on fission and fusion and needs help, he tries the problem himself and thinks he did it right and goes on his day. the next day he turns it in feeling confident about his work, the teacher grades the homework and gives back the papers, Generic_Name knows that he got an A but instead he got an F because he didnt ask anyone to help him and he has to pay the price. Generic_Name has science homework on fission and fusion and needs help, he tries the problem himself and then asks his parents they star the ones Generic_Name got wrong so that he can fix his mistakes. Now that Generic_Name double checked his work he earned an A. Additionally, Generic_Name has a orchestra concert and doesnt understand a note on his piece, he acts like he knows it and goes on. The teacher said, ""anyone need assistance,"" and no one answered. The orchestra was in the middle of the piece and the note was getting closer and closer to Generic_Name. The note hit and Generic_Name let out a loud shriek on his instrument and everyone looked at him like he was crazy, the judges marked down our score and we got a three one of the worst grades in orchestra. Generic_Name has a orchestra concert today and is having a hard time understanding one note in the piece, he asks the teacher, ""What note is that on measure thirty two."" The teacher says D. Now they had a great concert and they got a one, the best score you can get.

Secondly, in case the first person you asked got it wrong. For instance, Generic_Name has a lab in science and is working with elephant toothpaste, he wants it to explode just like in the movies. Generic_Name did all the instructions and his partner double checked we were good to go. Then we let it go and nothing happened, we were both looking at each other confused. The teacher looked at what we did wrong and we didnt put the acid in the tube. Generic_Name is in lab today, they are trying to make elephant toothpaste. Generic_Name looked at all the instructions and his partner double checked, we raised our hand to tell the teacher that we are ready and the teacher checked the lab and they forgot the acid. Now that they have the acid they can see the big, foamy explosion. Another example, Generic_Name has soccer practice and needs to know the play that the coach is going pick, the coach wasnt paying attention and said, ""Oh um lets do route five."" Generic_Name agrees and starts the play, he goes up the field passes to the player up top he passes back down and Generic_Name kicks it. The play is simple but the defense didnt here them so they started without the defense paying attention. Generic_Name kicks it and hits the goalie in the face and the goalie was stunned because he didnt see it and fell. If the coach was paying more attention then it wouldnt have happened. Generic_Name is at soccer practice and coach was not paying any attention and Generic_Name asks what play coach said, ""Lets do route five."" Generic_Name nodes his head and goes on. The assistant coach says hold up, the defense isnt even ready. The assistant coach tells the defense the play. No one has to get injured.

Lastly, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at. For example, Generic_Name has a science fair that is due today and he dosen't comprehend one of the slides he is scared that he wont make the finals, but he turns it in anyways and the judges are looking at Generic_Name's science fair project. They are on the part where Generic_Name was worried on, they scoped it out very strictly and gave Generic_Name a score. He got second place all because of that one slide. Generic_Name has a science fair due today and he has one problem, he has a question on what to do on this slide. The other groups were nice enough to help Generic_Name out and get him first place. Adding on, Generic_Name was a straight A student and did not want to lose her streak. Generic_Name has a very important essay to do for a grade. It is worth sixty percent of her grade, she does not want to get a bad grade on the essay because then her grade will turn into a C. She has a question but dosent want the other people to know that she isnt smart so she keeps it in. On the essay she is nervous and is confused but she turns it in anyways, she regrets not telling anyone about her question. She got a B on it and now she is not a straight A student. Generic_Name has an essay due today and has a question she asks a lot of her class mates the question and they told her, Now Generic_Name is ready and prepared for the essay.

Generic_Name is having a test tomorrow and has a question, she asks her dad what is ten plus ten is he says twenty one Generic_Name believes him but still asks her mom, she said it was twenty. Now that I know the answer I can get an A and pass math class. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see if it is truly the right answer, in case the first person that looked at it did it wrong, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at.",170,21,0.7801,0.2631,0.972,0.4397,0.5647,25.7,528,625,"[5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1]",11,3.9603
8775,"How would exploring venus be dangerous? Well first of all in the text is states that the planets surface is an average of over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Thats pretty hot compared to the temperatures that we get here in the US. Some countries may be hotter than others but no one is near 800 degrees. That would be a very dangerous trip for any one knowing how hot it is there. It also states that the atmospheric acid pressure ios 90 times greater that what we experience on pur own planet. It also states that this type of environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Yes I agree that many people would want to see up close what things are on Venus but now in time there is no way that we could get a human up there and get samples of things mainly becuase of the pressure and the temperature.

Studying Venus is a definant worth pursuit but like i said earlier the teperature and the pressure is to hard for any human to get up there. Getting even a rock from Venus would help us learn things about the planet that we may not even know about today. They said in the passage that they have gotten robots out to venus but that is still hard to tell anything because Venus is a very cloudy planet, but even with a robot it is still hard to tell anything because of the fact that robots are good but they can't always work the way that you want them to work. In the passage it asks why scientists are discussing further visits to its surface? thats a good question that I would even ask them. The answer to that question is that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Eart-like planet in ur solar system. It says that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. From what people and scientists have said today about Venus it doesn't sound like it has that anymore. If it is 800 degrees on that planet all the oceans are gone and I don't think that they will return because of that. If your planet is 800 degrees all your oceans are dried up and any type of water is dried up as well.

I agree with the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. If you go to Venus you will most likely die but if you don't go how are we going to study anything from that planet, and how are we going to learn anything about the planet itself. It says in the passage striving to meet the challenges presented by venus has values, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but shold be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. In the is paragraph is is saying that even though venus would be very hard to research that we should saty with venus and one day be able to go their and study. even if it is dangerous, some sientists want to go their even for the danger that it may constist of. Going to Venus would be awesome but at the same time I don't know if going their for the risks that it has would be the smartest thing to do. You could go their and 5 minutes leater be dead. I wouldn't want to do that because I would want to live. Some people are different than me because they like adventure and getting out of their comfort zone but for me that wouldn't be the case.

Going to venus would be a huge sucess but the risks that it has I don't know if going their is worth it. Being able to study everything that it has on the planet would be huge. Learing about the things that go on there would also be huge to know. In the end If you as an individual would like to go the Venus and study the planet and the things that go on their you should go for it even at the dangers that it holds. If you are the type of person that enjoys adventure and learning about new things, I would say that this is the type of adventure that you would want to go on. I say this because of the simple reason that Venus has never been searched in depth, I mean in paragraphy two it states that spacecrafts that have landed their have only been able to survive for a few hours. obviously you could explore a little bit with this amount of time but with an entire planet it would be hard to only have a few hours to explore. you could definantly get a decent way with a few hours but because its an entire planet it would be very hard to discover new things because the craft can't go very fast and the craft can't move as fast as a human would be able to with a few hours. would you rather have multiple humans go out their and research or would you rather have one spacecraft go and research only one way for a few hours. Even if the humans know that they most likely would survive for very long. they could grab somethings that they could put into the shuttle and then the shuttle would return home and the scientists would be able to study later wen the shuttle returns home with all the possible things that the astronauts found on Venus. If Humans went out on a mission to study it states that 97 perscent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmostphere. (Paragraphy3) You know how hard it would be for someone to survive in that type of weather. If you send a astronaut to go and research you are basically asking one of you men to go up there and risk his life to study what is up there.

In the passage it says that Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin But I disagree with that statement. Venus is way more toxic and way for dangerous for humans to go up and study. For one thing the temperature is way to high and the amount of chemicals that could possibly kill you are things that are way to dangerous for any human to go and study. If you send a man up there you are asking him to die to research things that could be useful. if you step onto venus's land you are most likely going to die because of the difference on everything from what your used to. even is suits you are most likely going to die because of the differences.

10707,"Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.

School brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". It also states ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor"". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.

There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". It also states ""The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"". This evidence illustrates by the aouthor shows how great and advanced this technology is, being able to identify not only one emotion, but more than one at the same time, letting the world know, but most important the teachers in a classroom that they don't have to worry more about to be able to identify by guessing how a student is doing, because this technology has the answers. It is so hard to identify when a person is feeling all types of feelings and not be able to help out becuase no one knows what the mixed feelings are . Teachers have a rough time with students trying to figure it out. But with ths technology teahcers would be more notified of the problem, so they create a scenari to help them out.

Emotions are everywhere, everyone experience at least one of them. This new technology not only helps the person to express an emotion but to produce them. A teacher in a classroom is able to teach but sometimes they are not able to transmit the feeling of learing to the students, and the new technology Facial Action Coding System would be a lot of help. In the passage it states ""The Mona Lisa is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". It also states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, incluiding emotional communication"". By this evidence the author projects how this new technology is capable of doing just anything and how it helos to improve the best on a classroom, helping out not only the students but the teachers. With this new technology teachers would be able to get the students to be more interested in the class, leading them to get a good grade, and to the understanding of every new topic.

Now, Do you think this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?. By being able to detect 6 basic emotions and even mixed emotions, to recognize whether a student is bored or confused and by helping the person not only to express the emotion but to produce it, it is shown that this new technology is valuable. Communication is one of the basic steps to create a better living world but sometimes communication is just not implemented in society. So the help of this new technology is needed. A teacher woulld be able to help a student is they knew if the students where confused or bored. They would try different types of ways to get back the attention of the students so they can do good in the calls. Another reason is being able not only to know one emotion but multiple emotions; Teachers wouldn't have to be guessing the emotions of the studetns, and the time lose trying to guess their emotions, they would be finding ways to help the student solve their problem, becuase they already know what is going on. In the classroooms it is very hard for the sdtudents to concentrate in a very boring topic, and the teachers just will continue beuase the sdtudents just don't communicate or show anything else than just a black emotion and this new technology is able to get the person to express the emotion. Is really interesting what this technology can do.

25991,"80% of Americans believe seeking multiple opinions can help them make better choices, and for good reason. Studies have shown the average Americans faring far better in their lives compared to their counterparts because they are listening to other's advice. There are also many myths that have the moral of listening to other people's opinions. For example, Perseus got his achievement of slaying a gorgon because he listened to the Oracle. Another example I have is the fable of Osiris, in which Osiris listens to Sekhmet and becomes the king of he underworld. In all of these stories, the hero listens to other people, and benefited from the people around them being more knowledgeable, more experienced, and giving the hero more choices to consider. Therefore, I believe listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice because they have more experience compared to you, know the pros and cons of your choice, and gives you multiple perspectives to deliberate over.

For example, let us talk about the anecdote of little Generic_Name, whose life was changed forever by listening to a person who has more experience than him. As a young lad, little Generic_Name always dreamed of becoming a soldier, because he admired his mother who fought in WW2. But Generic_Name's mother, who lived through the inhospitable battlefield, didnt want her child to follow her path. As a result, she talked to him about the hardships that plagued her when she was a soldier, and successfully changed his mind. Thanks to Generic_Name's mother changing little Generic_Name's mind, He became a successful and joyous doctor who saves countless of lives every day. If Generic_Name's mother hadn't been a soldier who has lived through the darkest depths of hell called the battlefield, then she wouldn't have been able to change little Generic_Name's mind, and he may have had his life cut short. Another story we can talk about is the story of little Generic_Name, who always wanted to be a magician. Generic_Name always fantasizes about being on stage, listening to the crowds wild applause as she entertains them, and thankfully, her father is there to fulfill her fantasies. Thanks to Generic_Name's father being a renowned magician, he had the connections and knew the tricks that could excite the crowd. As a result, Generic_Name became the greatest magician of that generation. If Generic_Name's father wasnt a magician who had walked the path Generic_Name was planning to walk, then she wouldnt have been able to reach the heights she was reaching right now. Therefore, I believe that listening to people who have more experiences compared to you an help you make a better judgment.

Another anecdote we can talk about is the anecdote of Generic_Name, a menacing ancient man who knew the pros and cons of doing drugs. As Generic_Name was walking the streets of New Jersey, he saw a group about to eat drugs. Generic_Name walked towards the group, and he latched his hand on to the nearest person's, and stopped the person from doing some drugs. Generic_Name reprimanded the group about doing drugs, and thanks to his menacing presence, the group stopped downing some pills. Thanks to the effort of Generic_Name who lectured the group about the pros and cons of eating drugs, the group was saved from the evil influences of drugs, and grew up to be a group who fought against drug use. If Generic_Name wasn't telling the group about the pros and cons of drugs, they would have eaten it and fallen into a path which is very hard to recover from. But thankfully, Generic_Name saved them from that despairing future. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted o be doctor. Generic_Name didn't know much about being a doctor, except that she wanted to be one, so her grandfather talked with her about her choice. As they discussed the pros and cons of being a doctor, Generic_Name grew more knowledgeable about the choice she is going to make. As a result, Generic_Name is much more firm in her beliefs about being a doctor, and grew up to be an amazing doctor. If she didnt' talk with her grandfather about her choice, she would have made an uniformed decision that likely would have ruined her life. Therefore, I believe that listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice by giving them the pros and cons of their choice.

One anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted to be a lawyer because her friend's advised her. She was steadfast in her beliefs as she always enjoyed rules and regulations, until her mother gave her a new perspective to mull over. She told her to aim to become a supreme dragon, rather than being a struggling python.

As a result, Generic_Name aimed to be a supreme judge, and she became one at the age of 65. Thanks to her mother giving her better advice, She became a star that outshone other's in the world of law. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name whose life changed thanks to a fateful encounter that changed his life. Generic_Name felt forced to be a fashion designer, as it was a family tradition.

He didn't know what to do, until he heard his grandmother talking with his family about animal cloning. He grew interested in animal cloning and researched it until he considered it a his future career. As a result, he grew up to become a biologist, doing something he loves. If it wasn't for his grandmother telling Generic_Name's family members about animal cloning, he wouldn't have even considered it, and may have grown to be a nihilistic person who isn't able to change his fate of suffering. Therefore, I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can give them multiple perspectives to consider.

In conclusion, little Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and many more changed their entire lives by listening to other people. If they didn't seek other's advice, they would have fallen into a path that would not allow their potential to bloom. But, thankfully, they chose to listen to other people. As a result, they grew to be figures that were respected around the world.

25180,"Generic_Name is a rising 9th grader. Generic_Name's school is having their students choose their high school classes this week, and he doesn't know what classes he should take. He wants to take all AP classes because he thinks it will help when he applies for colleges in the future. Generic_Name asks, ""Generic_Name, do you think I should take all AP classes?"" ""Yes! They're super easy and fun,"" Generic_Name exclaims. Generic_Name doesn't know a lot about AP classes, he doesn't have any older siblings and he hasn't talked to his teachers about his schedule yet. Generic_Name responds, ""Wow! Thanks for the advice, I'm definitely going to take them."" The next morning he drops his schedule off at the guidance office. Generic_Name overhears Ms. Generic_Name, the guidance counselor, talking to a student in her office. ""Make sure to only take the classes you can handle. AP classes are extremely challenging and you should only take about 2 or 3,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. Generic_Name's heart drops to his feet, he had no idea how hard the classes were! Suddenly he gets a rush of rage and storms to Generic_Name's locker. Generic_Name yells, ""Why would you tell me the classes are easy? Ms. Generic_Name was talking about how hard they are and I already turned in my schedule!"" ""I'm sorry, I had no idea! I don't know a lot about high school and I thought they would be easy because I have all A's,"" Generic_Name says. Generic_Name responds, ""Dang, I should've asked more people about it."" When people ask for advice, they should talk to more than one person and seek multiple opinions because different people have different amounts of knowledge on topics, people have different points of view, and people have different experiences.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different amounts of knowledge. For example, if one person is an aspiring fashion designer and another is just an ordinary teenager, you would want to ask them both for their opinions on your outfit because they have different amounts of knowledge on fashion. Most people have a certain topic, hobby, or sport that they know a lot about, so asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make the right decision because you might find someone that has a lot of knowledge on the topic you're asking about. Another example is if someone was asking me what instrument they should choose to play, I could give them a lot of information because I play an instrument, but if they asked someone who has no knowledge on music and doesn't play an instrument they wouldn't get a lot of information. You might not know your friends have a lot of knowledge on a topic until you ask them. Simply asking multiple people for their opinions can spark a conversation in which you learn a lot about the topic.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different points of view. For example, if you're asking people for advice about what you should do when you have a problem with your friend, some people might tell you to go to a counselor and work it out, and some people might just tell you to talk to the person about it. When you ask different people for their opinions you can see how many people have the same opinion on a topic and how many people disagree with it. If everybody you ask about a topic has a certain opinion, but only one person disagrees, you wouldn't just go with the one person disagreeing. If you only ask that one person about the topic then you could've made the wrong choice, but if you ask multiple people for their points of view you can make the right choice and get more insight. Furthermore, when a lot of people have the same opinion on something, it is most likely the right choice.

When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different experiences. People have different experiences and their experiences can cause them to have more wisdom than others. For example, if you ask people on advice about where you should travel, you might find people who have a lot of experience traveling and they can give you their opinions and share their wisdom. If you only asked one person and that person has never even left the country, then you aren't getting a wise, reliable opinion. Another example is if you're asking an adult or a professional about the topic then they are clearly more wise because they are either specialized in that field or simply have lived longer and have more experiences in general. People who have a lot of wisdom are responsible and reliable. They'll think about the outcome of your decision and all the possible negatives, this makes them really good people to ask for advice and they'll probably choose the best option for you.

Generic_Name goes to Ms. Generic_Name's office to ask her if he could take his schedule paper back. She gives him the paper back and asks him if he needs any advice. Generic_Name says, ""Yes actually, I was wondering if you could help me decide if I should take a lot of AP classes or not."" ""Of course! You should only take AP classes for the classes you're really interested in and have a B+ or higher,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. ""Oh, that makes sense, I think I'm going to take AP bio, AP geometry, and AP world history because those are my favorite classes and I have a good grade in all of them,"" Generic_Name says. Ms. Generic_Name replies, ""Now that sounds like a way better option than what you chose before."" Generic_Name chuckles. He is dismissed to go back to lunch and he asks Generic_Name for his opinion too. Generic_Name asks, ""Do you think I should take AP bio, AP geometry, and AP world history?""

20611,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.                              ",172,11,0.8798,0.2607,0.9749,0.4857,0.5842,22.6471,521,599,"[1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 1, 1, 5, 5, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 5, 0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2]",0,4.4554
6961,"Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn't have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name's alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, ""Are you on your way to football practice?"" ""Unfortunately,"" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn't bad at football, he just didn't enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn't because too many people who didn't want to participate signed up. ""How's the student council?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,"" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn't have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn't enjoy it as much because those who didn't want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn't have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren't interesting to them. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.

The first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students' after school activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after school activities.

Another reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they're being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won't be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn't interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren't provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don't wish to participate.

In addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don't want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you're on a team, whether it's a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn't putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who's not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they're interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyable if a student doesn't participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.

Generic_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team's effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. ""Guess what?"" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. ""What?"" Generic_Name replied curiously. ""I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!"" ""Congratulations, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, ""See you later, Generic_Name."" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn't have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team's effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.",166,16,0.8242,0.2684,0.9704,0.4366,0.5628,19.9153,481,581,"[5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 0, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 1, 5, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 6, 4, 1, 2, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 6, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 6, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 5, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5]",6,4.4187
2692,"The limitation of car use provides many improvements to our envionment and health. Many different places have now started to get into the habit of preferring to use bicycles, car-pools, or even walking. Limiting car use could lead to less polution, more activity, and even safety. If we were to limit the use of cars, we could save many lives, including our own. While limiting the usage of cars many doors could open that leads many different places. Limiting cars could possibly terminate childhood and adulthood obesity. It could also provide happiness and joy, and even willing exercise. Cars both hinder, and help us, it gets the people where they need to go, but it ruins the environment and makes many people  lathargic.

With the limitation of cars comes the major improvement on polution.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (1, Rosenthal). Passenger cars are responsible for 12 precent of the greenhouse emissions found in Europe, and where most cars are used the greenhouse gass emissions are up to 50 percent. The amount of gas that is polluting the air is asoultly hazardous to the health of many people. ""...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (1, Duffer). Paris eventually needed to ban driving due to the smog that was being produced from the cars. As stated in the ariticle, ""...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (1, Rosenthal). If we were to limit the car usage, many smog and greehouse gases would not be as much of an issue as it is now. If we were to limit the usage of cars and prefer to car-pool, alot of gas, money, and lives. With the limiting of car usage comes the possibility of living a longer, healthier life without pollution tearing a hole in the ozone layer.

Limiting the use of cars can also produce more activity among the people and hapiness. Limiting the use of cars forces many people to start walking, using trains, running, and even bicycling. As states in the article, ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nations"" (1, Rosenthal). Many places are now starting to realize that the people are slowly loosing interest in cars and now perfer to walk, run, or even take public transportation. As stated in the articaly, ""..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work leaving a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.... 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution'"" (1, Selsky). ""It has seen the construction of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American cirt....Parks and sports centers also have bloomes throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (1, Selsky). Many citizens are starting to prefer to walk rather than drive. The perople are slowly moving away from motor vehicles and are starting to go outside and to exercise. As mentioned in the article, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (1, Rosenthal) This choice is making alot most people happy and satified.  Many people no longer need to fret about gas money or traffic, or even about arriving on time. Having no car is a stress-reliever that saves you time, stress, and keeps you from pulling at your hair. Exercising is also a much easier way to be able to blow off steam and reduce stress.

Another positive of limiting car use is the safety that is provided. Many Americans are now choosing to not recieve a license. The people are slowly moving away from the driving of cars and are now preferring to use public transportation, or even walking. People are now slowly starting to center their lives around where it could be easy to transport. Their place of work could now be centered around where public transport is able to drop them off, a walking distance, or even on the normal route that a friend, whom you could be able to catch a ride, wouldn't mind dropping you off at. As stated in the article, ""They organize their summer jobs and soical life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" (1, Rosenthal).  Another reason why many people do not drive, is due to the fact that many families and people cannot afford a vehicle, or they choose to not purchase one. As stated in the artice, ""'What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn'"" (1, Rosenthal). With less amount of people on the road, this lowers the possible chances of someone being in an accident. The possibility of poeple being in car accident have been lowered, because a majority of the people are refusing to drive. As mentioned in an artice, ""When adjusted to the population growth, th enumber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short...the number of miles driven perperson was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" (1, Rosenthal). If the people were to drive less this would mean less accidents and less pollution which could lead to lenghtier lives and to healthier lives.

In conclusion, with the limitation on the use of automobiles comes the many possibilities that could possibly save lives and re-shape them into something much more healthier. While reducing the usage of automobiles comes exercise and the relief os stress. Maybe childhood or adulthood obesity would not be as large of an issue if were reduced car usage. Many people could then be healthier and more involeved in their communities. With the limitation of car usage comes the unlimited possibilities.

Generic_Name's feet dragged on the concrete as he sighed, walking into the school. The building towered over him while casting a gloomy, gray shadow. As he entered the school, Generic_Name's so called ""friends"" ignored him and talked behind his back. He had known for a while that his friends hated him, but Generic_Name hadn't had the chance to gain better friends. The boys approached Generic_Name and start ranting about how stupid he was. This was the last straw. ""I'm done with you guys!"" Generic_Name yelled, and stormed off. ""Fine with us,"" one of his old friends said. Now friendless and depressed, Generic_Name wished the school day could be over as he trudged off to his first class.

""Alright class,"" Generic_Name's teacher said while students entered the room, ""Can anyone answer this question?"" No one made a sound. Everyone stared at the teacher pointing to the equation on the board. It was so quiet, you could hear the pin drop from Generic_Name's desk. Generic_Name knew the answer, but he was scared to answer. Generic_Name's teacher sighed. She said, ""Today we will start a group project. I'll assign groups. Remember to work together."" Generic_Name moaned and expected the worst. His group ended up being consisted of students that didn't know how to work together. They ended up arguing over everything ""What happened to 'teamwork'?"" the teacher asked, startled. Generic_Name answered, ""Well if we had more opportunities to work with other people, we might know more about teamwork."" ""I better talk to the principal for more teamwork opportunities,"" Generic_Name's teacher said, shaking her head. I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make friends, increase self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.

The first reason why I support the decision of students participating in extra activities is that students can make friends. If students were able to join a club/activity of their choice, they would meet other people with similar interests, leading to new friends. For example, I have participated in the Generic_School Chamber Orchestra since 6th grade, and I met one of my current best friends at this club. I also have friends I met there that are at high school right now. I got closer to these people because I joined Chamber. All of us were advanced at playing an instrument, resulting in many similarities. Students with similar interests that join the same club usually have a lot of time to spend together, resulting in a friendship because they were able to connect for so long. A whole club could learn how fun it is to be around each other and even form a new friend group. I'm sure Generic_Name could use a new friend group right now!

The second reason why I support the principal's decision is that students could develop better self confidence. Some people don't try out for a sport because they are too nervous about what other people would think about them. If it was mandatory for these students to join or tryout, they could make it and see how good/talented they actually are. This results in higher confidence. A shy and low-esteemed student being part of a club and making friends could finally see how funny they are, making them happier with higher confidence. For instance, I have a friend that I dance with that had a low self confidence. She started making friends, and now she is very outgoing. Maybe if the shy girls tried out for the cheerleading team, they would join and become a preppy cheerleader stereotype.

The final reason why I agree with the decision of students having to participate in at least one activity is that students would develop teamwork skills. People who play sports or participate in clubs know that teamwork is important. A basketball team that passes the ball to each other is more likely to score than a team with one person doing everything. If students were ""forced"" to join an activity, they would develop teamwork skills that would help them for group projects. It would even help them in the future for when they get a job. There are very few jobs now where teamwork isn't important because people need each other to complete a task. For example, it would be hard for a construction worker to build a whole house by himself. If the school made it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would help them with teamwork tremendously (especially Generic_Name).

Bounce, bounce.

Generic_Name practically skips into the school because he is so excited for Robotics. Ever since the principal made all students join an extracurricular activity, all students seemed to be happy to come to school. The building welcomed all students to a new school day. ""Hey Generic_Name!"" calls out Generic_Name's new friends. Generic_Name met them by joining Robotics. He runs to them and the whole Robotics team dives into conversation. ""I'm so glad that I have such great friends that have similar interests as me,"" Generic_Name says cheerfully. Everyone laughs as they agree to walk to Robotics together. ""Hey everyone! Can anyone answer this question?"" Generic_Name's teacher asks while the students got settled in class. Everyone's hands shot up, including Generic_Name's. The teacher called on Generic_Name and he stated the right answer. ""Correct!"" the teacher said, and Generic_Name beamed. He was proud of himself and his new self confidence. He figured out how smart and funny he was after joining Robotics. He also figured out that he was great at math, and even led his team to victory at the Robotics Championship. ""Let's work on our projects!"" the teacher said. Generic_Name's group got together and they worked diligently for the rest of class. They each joined a club or sport, so they figured out teamwork. They worked together to produce an A+ worthy project. The teacher said, ""I'm so proud that you guys figured out teamwork. The principal made a great decision!"" I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because they can make friends, gain self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.",215,12,0.8943,0.2845,0.9647,0.4988,0.5854,15.0625,538,671,"[2, 2, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 0, 5, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 3, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 5, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 0, 5, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1]",26,4.3046
25042,"Receiving advice from others is like having someone else pick out your clothes; a weight is being lifted off you shoulders. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, for they will receive advice from others with more experience, it will help them grow as a individual, and it will be an eye opener to their situation.

To begin with, asking others for advice can benefit one in many ways. The person who they may be asking may be more experienced in the subject and help them out with their situation. For example, Generic_Name just began attending a new school. He has tried his best to make friends but he has failed. Generic_Name, very discouraged, decided to ask his mom for some pointers on how to make friends. When he got home from school he went right into the kitchen to ask his mom for some help. His mom simply said, ""Be yourself, they will come around, trust me."" Generic_Name was frustrated because he was being his self but they just looked at him like he was an alien. He knew it was time to turn to his older sister, Generic_Name. Later that evening when Generic_Name came home from basketball practice he knew it time to ask her what to do. After she had gotten settled he went into her room knowing she was his only hope. Generic_Name told him that, ""You are the new kid, fresh meat. Give them a break and do not try as hard to want their attention. The best way to gain someones attention is to not want it."" After doing exactly what his sister said to do, two of the boys from his gym class came and sat beside him at lunch. Generic_Name could have just went with his moms advice, but after talking to his sister he has now made two new friends.

Also, asking the advice of others helps one to grow. When someone asks for help they tend to remember how to deal with those specific situations later on in life. For instance, Generic_Name is struggling in her math class. Every time the class has a test she always finishes first, that is why she does not understand why her grades are not good in Ms. Generic_Name's math class. She told Generic_Name, ""I do not get it, I always finish my work first! I do not understand why I continue to get bad grades in here."" Ms. Generic_Name told her that, ""Not everything is a race Generic_Name. The test are not timed so there is no need to rush."" Generic_Name was very confused, she did not understand she thought if she finished fast that meant because she was so smart and did not need the extra time. When Generic_Name came to class the next day she asked her friends how they get such good grades on the test and they all said in a cautious tone, ""Read the questions carefully! Ms. Generic_Name is always trying to trick us."" When Ms. Generic_Name entered the classroom she announced to the class that they had a pop quiz. Generic_Name still thinking of what her teacher and friends told her took her time on the pop quiz and earned an ninety five percent. Generic_Name was so proud. From now on Generic_Name knew that in order to make good grades she would have to just slow down a bit and take her time. Like Ms. Generic_Name said, ""Slow and steady wins the race, or in this case receives a good grade.""

In addition, taking the advice from others can help one to see the situation from a different point of view. Sometimes a person looking from the outside in on the situation may just help find a solution to it. Specifically, Generic_Name and Generic_Name have been best friends for forever and they do everything together. Every summer Generic_Name and Generic_Name go to basketball camp together but not this year. Generic_Name just got excepted into the Generic_City Summer Science Camp she has been trying to get into since the first grade. Generic_Name was so excited she had to call up her best friend Generic_Name and tell her the great news except Generic_Name did not think it was so great. When summer came around for the first time they had to go their separate ways to different camps. Generic_Name was really mad but she still missed her best friend the whole summer. Generic_Name, on the other hand was loving science camp she wrote to Generic_Name everyday trying to see how she was doing and telling how the great time she was having. Generic_Name decided that she was not going to write Generic_Name back in return of her just up and leaving her for science camp. When the girls returned back to school Generic_Name ignored Generic_Name which left her sad and confused. Generic_Name had no idea why she was acting that way she decided to ask their other friends if any of them knew why Generic_Name was acting that way but no one knew. When Generic_Name got home for her first day back to school she was greeted by her mom who was now confused as to why she looked so upset. She shared with her mom what was going on and her mom knew exactly what was wrong with Generic_Name. ""Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name's mom said, ""She may be hurt because you left her you two do everything together."" Generic_Name now realizing what she had done ran up the steps and immediately called Generic_Name and apologized. Generic_Name was happy that her mom talked to her or she might have lost her best friend. That just goes to show that sometime having another person view the situation can help come up with a better solution.

However, some people feel that taking the advice from others is useless. They feel that solving their own problems helps them become a stronger individual. Other may not like everyone being in their business because they may be a more private individual. Getting advice from other may not be the best thing because some people feel they know what is right and may think they know how to fix the situation but they do not. On the contrary, I feel that asking others for advice is a great idea.

In conclusion, these are all reasons why everyone should ask more than one person for advice. The way it builds one character. Prepares them for the real world. It is always a good idea to get an outsiders opinion. Like my mom always says, ""It never hurts to ask for help.""                ",151,18,0.787,0.239,0.9701,0.443,0.5652,19.4921,504,608,"[4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 0, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]",8,4.1254
11942,"My Thoughts on the Story ""Making Mona Lisa Smile.""

Lets be real first before we get started on the real thing. Who came up with all these weird names for facial expressions and facial muscles, my goodness I thought I was surely going to get taken out of class from laughing so hard at these weird names.

I think that using technology to read someone emotions is horrible stupid. I mean come on why invade someones privacy. Why trust a computer when it can mulfunction, and calculate wrong. Yet some might say its a good thing to invade others personal emotions by using technology to see what their feeling and figure out why their feeling that way. Not everyones facial tissue or muscles are the same nor can you predict what their facial expressions mean as of emotions. Using a 3-D computer model of someones facial structer you can see the muscles of the face in different forms and can tell what emotions are showing.

Example: Your orbivularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show your anger. So the people who agree with using this technology would rely on the 3-D facial model of someone and look for muscle tightening or high raises of the eyebrows, or tightening of the jaw.

People who do not agree on this would say you can not always believe what technology says. Maybe someones facial expressions are natural. For instence someone who was born with difunctional issues; a lip attacthed to their nose, if someone were to use a picture of someone with a lip disorder and the persons lips are tight they assume it is cause they are mad. When in reality they might just be sad because their lip is stuck like that, and your assuming it's tight cause their mad.

Paragraph 5 talks about humans calculating everyday. well for one when the author says, ' You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" What makes you think it's a she it could be a he or a she. Don't assume genders author. Simply some people have trouble showing the right emotions too. For instance you could be happy and have a frown on your face and if someone were to send it the the facial computer and ask what is she/his emotions right now. Well the computer would say they are confused, when really they are happy and just had their face rested in a frown.

In paragraph 6 it says that, "" most human communcication is nonverbal, including emotional comunication. So computers need to understand that, too."" Dr. Huang notes said.

So why do computers need to understand how we feel? If we want someone to know how we feel, we will let them know. What's the point in wasting time working on a computer to figure out how someone feels when you could simply ask and not waste money and time on a computer that could malfunction? The author say's that the Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much the computer can do. Well it surely didn't bring a smile to my face.

Instead it made me think of lot's of questions on stuff like; what happens if your so called computer malfunctions? Where will everything go? Surely you have everything saved? Have you tested it on many people more than 20? Were those people all the same? Or were they different? Do you know what people will think of it, or how they will react to all this new technology? Why did you use technology? What happens when we go into a blackout and you can't rely on any of the technology? People will want answers and then turn on you cause you relyed on something that can't function without electricity.

Paragraph 7 explains some ""encoding"" emotions and what to do while looking in the mirror then the author says that those instructions are for a face that looks happy. Now if your smart and I shall hope you are, we both know if you go to a mirror and force your eyes to squint and force your lips to move upwards, and then raise your cheeks up. Lets just say that will not look like a happy face, it will look like someone who doesn't know how to smile and is trying ot force a fake smile that looks horrible wrong.

Paragraph 8 talks about how a muscle clue can tell when a politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. Well what if someone asks them a personal question and they don't want the whole world to know? And you go and use that computer on their 3-D face you made and tell the world they were lying to that question. Hm well you just ruined that for them and exposed them. Now I know what your thinking they wouldn't do that, and maybe your right or wrong. Their is always someone who can hack or get the full version of this what do you call it FACS, and that person would probably spill it to the world and thank you for creating that machine. Then you're sucked into the law suits and drama and people who would sew you for ruining the world or someones life.

In paragraph 9 the author says, "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Does it really? I mean you can't force a smile, and we all know faking a smile does not make you happy. These facts are from someone who probably just used a couple peoples facial expressions to get to publish his or her's book so why not ask more than a couple peoples opinions and what they say about all this.

I understand why you would want to read a studens emotional expressions during class to see how they feel and what you could do to make it better, but what if it doesn't get better and you try everything you can and their still sitting in calss bored and tired and not giving a rat? Then your stuck with a machine you don't need anymore and less money than you had because you wanted to spend it on a machine then asking the student's what they thought could help them.

Most people would spend money on machines to try to help kids because thats all their used to doing spending money on kids to make them happy, when in reality you just need to have them suck it up and pay attention reward them with things that don't cost a lot or something that doesn't cost anything.

42449,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unnecessarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford plumber's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" 11. If the louisiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to plumber's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winnertakeall system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winnertakeall system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winnertakeall system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a tossup carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" 21. While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished.

687,"Phones and Driving

Each year phones are getting more advanced, which makes them more addicting for society. This addiction has gotten so bad people use them while in the driver's seat. According to the NLM and NIH they say, ""After declining from 1999 to 2005, fatalities from distracted driving increased 28% after 2005, rising from 4572 fatalities to 5870 in 2008"". This proves the idea that distracted driving is growing because of the popularity of phones. Phones should not be allowed during driving because it puts lives at risk, it sets a bad example for future drivers, and it increases the chance for a car crash which means more cost for car damages. All drivers should pay attention to the road to ensure they are ready to respond to any situation.

All drivers should leave their phones while driving because it puts lives at risk. As stated by the Miller and Zois law firm more and more people are dying from distracted driving accidents a year. In the article it says, ""The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year."" The evidence given supports the idea that due to the use of phones being so popular the number of people in an accident increases and that many of these accidents could have been avoided if drivers had paid attention to the road. In an article made by TeenSafe, it provides an incident about a woman that killed and injured young children due to texting and driving. In the article it says, ""In May of 2017, Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving."" This was a sad accident that was caused because of the use of phones while driving. The evidence shows that the use of phones while driving causes innocent drivers to turn into killers. Phones should not be used while driving since it causes lives to be lost.

The use of phones while driving should not be allowed because it spreads to the next generation. If the older drivers text while driving it shows newer drivers that it's ok to do it. According to a survey done by Jama Pediatrics, many parents say that using phones while driving is bad but about half of them still do it. In the article, it states, ""Indeed, 52 percent of millennial parents (22 to 37 years old) and 58 percent of older parents said they thought it was 'never' safe to text and drive..... But almost two-thirds of parents have read texts while driving, and more than half of them have also written texts, the survey of 435 parents in 45 U.S. states found."" The evidence provided helps prove that parents are not providing exemplary performances for their kids who will one day grow up repeating the process. With this study done by Jama Pediatrics it stamps the idea that texting and driving should stop with the older drivers to make sure the future of driving is bright for the newer. The NHTSA has ways on lowering the rate of distracted driving crashes. As stated by the NHTSA they say, ""Parents first have to lead by example-by never driving distracted-as well as have a talk with their young driver about distraction and all of the responsibilities that come with driving. Have everyone in the family sign the pledge to commit to distraction-free driving."" This is an important comment because the next generation of drivers wouldn't now the exemplary way of driving if someone didn't show them. If parents or other qualified drivers don't teach kids the exemplary way to drive then lots of car accidents are going to happen and one of them might lose a life

Texting and driving is a dangerous activity and should not be allowed because of the increased chance of a car crash and the cost of that crash. In any car accident it can cost a lot to repair the damages and if the driver is in continuous car accidents due to texting and driving the cost can double. According to Peachtree Financial Solutions they say, ""In the event that an individual is involved in an accident with substantial damage, the typical cost can run approximately $5000 to start and then quickly increase from there, depending on the specifics of the accident."" This was included to show how much money a person could have to pay for in a car accident which could have been done by texting and driving. A study done by The Zebra on young drivers presents critical information. For example, the article says, ""Including the cost to people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion - or 15 percent - of the overall societal damage caused by motor vehicle crashes. This number only goes up after your primary offense."" The evidence shown explains that the cost of car crashes is very high. This can be best interpreted that getting into a car crash would not be beneficial to a person in a person in a car crash a situation which could be caused by texting and driving. If the cost of car crashes is constantly increasing each year then people shouldn't be texting and driving because it causes car crashes.

The evidence shown above helps prove that phones are dangerous to use while driving because it puts lives at risk, sets bad examples for future drivers, and it increases the chance of a car crash which means a lot of money to pay for damage. It's important to realize that if we don't take more offensive action to stop texting while driving then it will ruin the lives of families. If we don't stop this, the bad actions will carry on to the next generation and the next until we stop.

If we don't stop this then car crashes will continue to occur and the price for the damage will skyrocket. Texting while driving needs to be taken more seriously or the world will be chaotic.

20311,"I feel that keeping the Electoral College is the wrong way to go. That changing it to election by popular vote is a better decision. Because the people of our nation should be able to choose who they want to be the president not the 538 electors. Why not have the whole nation vote for who they want and who ever has the majority of the votes win? That sounds like a fair election to me! The electoral college has so many faults, that just one little tiny mishap can cause a huge disater within the election.

The electoral college does have some advantages. Like swing states, or avoiding run-off elections . But it also has disadvantages for example it takes so many risks, its unfair to voters, its outdated, and irrational.

The electoral college cheats the people who are voting. I mean they didn't sign up or vote for the electors

NO, they did it for the president. So why not give them that chance? It makes it easier on other people and the election is a fair one.

The picking and choosing of the electors is unorganized. Each year its a different person.

Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves.

Voters that go and vote for which ever president they want, really aren't even voting for the president their voting for that president's elector. Which is someone who goes and votes for that president that picked them as their elector. And sometimes the voter that is actually voting for the elector to vote for their assigned president will end up voting for a different president. Also voters will sometimes get confused about all these electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

So in conclusion, changing from Electoral College would be the best choice to make. Because election by popular vote for the president isn't so complicated, is more reliable, isn't so risky, and most importantly the voters get a fair election.

42173,"Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save money. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park"" Rosenthal 2 but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. ""Carowners can buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Rosenthal 2 That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars "" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of vaughn's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a ""partial driving ban to clear the air or global city"" Duffer 10. For example, in this article called "" "" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be 31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about ""4,000 drivers were fined,"" and ""27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" Duffer 12. Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" Duffer 14. The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of ""7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Selsky 21 Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has ""118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City."" Selsky 27 One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called "" "", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Rosenthal 29 The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, ""Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Rosenthal 29. New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air unless it's a hybrid. The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.",125,10,0.8519,0.1802,0.9774,0.4555,0.5732,22.8571,547,656,"[1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4]",1,3.9258
23059,"Millions of people attend school everyday all around the World. Many of these people attend classes at public schools rather than taking classes online because people feel as though classes at public school are a better option and are more beneficial. However, online classes provide the same learning curriculum and information as public schools do. The only major difference between the two class options are that online cclasses allow people to take classes from home. Taking classes from home allows for students to experience the benefits of working in a more comfortable setting, increases their ability to focus, and teaches the importance of responsibility.

In order for students to work productively they need to be within a comfortable environment. Online classes allows for students to experience this. For Example, Generic_Name took Biology online from home for his 1st semester and he always turned in his work on time and always finished his work within 30 minutes to an hour, but Generic_Name's shy friend Generic_Name who didn't take the class online and went to school hardly turned in his work on time and was always slacking off. Generic_Name being able to independently work from home in a comfortable setting allowed him to work in a efficient manor. When students are uncomfortable in the environment they can't work productively because they don't feel comfortable. Without being comfortable in situations students constantly get sidetracked and can't get work done because they may feel as though they are being judged or face issues of uncertainty. Another example is Generic_Name took Algebra 2 online from home her Sophomore year in High School and always knew what she was doing and how to solve the mathematical equations properly, however her boyfriend Generic_Name who took the class at school struggled with finishing his work and keeping a good grade in the class. Generic_Name having the ability to do her work in her bed and being comfortable while she did her work allowed for her to complete her work. Without comfort students struggle to process certain criteria because they aren't relaxed and can't comprehend material that is given to them because they will focus on the fat that they are uncomfortable. Students must feel as though they are in a calming environment in order to work efficiently.

Students are only able to truly focus when they aren't distracted by others. Online classes decrease the vast amount of distractions that public schooling classes have. For Instance, Generic_Name has a project in her AP Environmental Science class online that is due in 3 weeks so as soon as she gets the assignment she starts to work on the project, on the other hand Generic_Name's friend Generic_Name who takes the same class in school and received the same project didn't even think to look at the paper because she decided to talk to people in her class instead. Generic_Name doesn't experience the distractions that Generic_Name does because Generic_Name takes the class by herself and doesn't have to deal with multiple people left and right. When students are away from constant distractions they have the ability to truly focus on the task at hand. Another instance is Generic_Name has to read 20 pages everyday for his AP Literature class and always succeeds to do so, yet his friend Generic_Name who takes the book at school and has time to read in class consistently fails to read the assigned work because he is always staring at a girl in his class. With Generic_Name taking the class from home and not having to deal with being distracted by a girl he thinks is pretty all the time allows for him to stay on task and pay attention. Students can easily experience concentration issues when they are surrounded by multiple people rather than just being by themselves because the mind tends to wonder when in a environment of multiple people. In order for students to remain on task they can't be within an environment that distracts them.

When doing a task on one's own terms they learn how to be responsible. Online classes teach students that it is their personal responsibility to complete tasks given to them. One example is Generic_Name had was taking Spanish online from home and his teacher doesn't send out emails of when the assignments need to be completed, but his girlfriend Generic_Name who takes his class at school always gets reminders during class when the assignments are due. Generic_Name has to consistently check for work himself rather than always relying on his teacher to tell him. Generic_Name's online teacher doing this will allow students to learn that they are responsible for knowing what and when assignments are due. Another example is Generic_Name was doing work online from home and was notified once online that in one week before that his exam was coming up and had to study for the test, yet his friend Generic_Name who attended school and took the same class and had the same teacher was informed 3 times during the week before the exam that he had to study before the exam. Without daily meetings with teachers the students have to take the initiative to follow the instructions they are given. If the instructions aren't followed it is on the student that they had not been active online and payed attention when the information was provided.

Overall online classes can be very helpful to students and their learning processes. Online classes allow for students to feel comfortable while learning, pay more attention to information, and realize that they must keep up with assignments given. Students have the ability to feel more comfortable and complete their work when they take classes at home rather than taking classes in school. Online classes can also help decrease the number of issues that may take attention away from the given tasks. These classes also allow for students to learn that they have the duty to keep themselves informed and that they can't rely on others for work. Ultimately online classes are an excellent option for students to take and students should consider the multiple benefits that come with taking classes from home. ",152,10,0.8765,0.2656,0.9822,0.4693,0.5806,28.7105,501,559,"[3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 0, 2, 5, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 5, 2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 5, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 0, 5, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]",0,4.6948
6254,"""SLAM!"" Generic_Name throws the door back behind her. Generic_Name's mother flies down the stairs so fast, she nearly face plants into the wall ahead. ""What's the matter honey?"" ""Ughh! My new principal just announced that all students are now required to participate in an extracurricular activity everyday after school, and i don't have any interest in that!"" Generic_Name shrieks.""Well why is that such a bad thing?"" her mom says calmly.""That's the point! i don't want to waste my time after school on something stupid like that. I would rather be relaxing by myself after all of my homework,"" Generic_Name answers irritably. ""Come on, you could make new friends, and might surprise yourself with new interests.""I think it would be really good for you,"" her mom explains. ""Well I disagree,"" Generic_Name responds. ""Please would you give it a try? I see opportunity for you here. I really do,"" Her mom pushes. ""I don't need more people or friends in my life. Besides, none of the activities offered sound appealing to me at all,"" Generic_Name says. "" How about cross country? You know your dad and i used to do it when we were younger, and when you were little you always talked about how you wanted to be a runner like me when you got older. Just try it, and if you really don't like it, i'll go talk to your principal about the requirement,"" her mom offers. ""I don't know,"" Generic_Name contemplates. ""Think about all of the great opportunities and things that could come out of this!"" Generic_Name's mom says positively. ""Please?"" her mom tries one last time. Generic_Name sighs. ""I guess,"" she finally agrees. Forced extracurricular activities will benefit students in many ways, especially by motivating ones that do not typically do activities. Our school should continue to require students to participate in extracurricular activities because it provides balance in their schedules, helps them to build new friendships, and gives them the opportunity to try new things.

The first reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it provides balance in students' schedules. Balance is one thing that is very important, especially when it comes to middle and high school; colleges look at whether a student can manage an activity with all of the school work as a big factor in the admissions process. For example, My older sister applied to UVA last year; She had straight A's, a great GPA and SAT score, but got denied because she wasn't a balanced student. She claims that if she would have had a required extracurricular activity, she would have had a better high school experience because it would force her to have a little more fun, which she needed at the time.

Another example of the lack of balance is that my older brother comes home stressed and angry everyday because he's so determined about keeping his grades up in high school. His favorite sport used to be football, until his classes started getting harder and he stopped playing. However, next year he is going to step down from one of his hard classes, so he can play football again and still keep his grades up; therefore, he will regain his much needed balance again. If our school continues to require these extracurricular activities, it will prepare students for high school by showing them that they need to have a balanced school-work life to both mentally and physically succeed.

The next reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it helps students build new friendships. It is very important to have good friends throughout middle school and high school because you will need people to talk to about things, support you in situations. and even just to share laughter and spend time with that aren't your family. For example, when i started middle school my parents made me try out for track, which i really didn't want to do. After a few days, i had made so many great friends that i could not only hang out with at practice, but i also then knew them at school. To this day, i am even better friends with those people, therefore, i can't imagine what my life would be like if i hadn't tried out for track. Another example is my older brother made his closest friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, in football when he first started high school. Before that, he didn't have many good friends; football really changed his life in that way, for i never see him happier than when he is with them.

The final reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it gives students the opportunity to try new things. If you aren't required to do something, most of the time you probably won't do it unless it interests you; however if you are required to do something, you will be forced to do it no matter what, but you might surprise yourself, and find interest in that thing after all. Like mentioned previously, my parents made me try out for track when i first started middle school. At first, i wasn't the biggest fan of the idea, but i decided to give it a try; i ended up surprising myself, and Absolutely loved it. I was one of the best sprinters on my team, and found running to be a great way to release my negative energy from the day. Another example of this is my friend Generic_Name; she had no interest in sewing at all, but her mom forced her to try the sewing club at her school. Vivian ended up really enjoying it, and found it very therapeutic, as it was a great way to let out her stresses from the school day.

Squeak! Generic_Name's front door's hinges make a sound as she opens it. The stench of sweat fills the kitchen as Generic_Name and her friends topple in, one after another.""Oh my goodness you girls stink!"" Generic_Name's mom laughs and plugs her nose. ""Did you have a good run?"" She asks. ""Yes we're loving it!"" Generic_Name exclaims with a huge grin. ""I knew you would,"" her mom winks at her.

By continuing to extracurricular activities, schools will positively benefit students by providing balance in their schedules, building new friendships, and giving them the opportunity to try new things.",202,13,0.8791,0.281,0.9654,0.4465,0.5648,18.9697,520,633,"[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 5, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 6, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 6, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 6, 4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 0, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1]",43,4.0703

Since Generic_Name is 13 years old, she has the option of either staying with one of her parents or being put up for adoption. She wakes up one morning for school, trying not to make a sound because she doesnt want her parents waking up and starting her day of with screaming. When she manages to get out the house she puts a fake smile on and carries on her day. Throughout it, she asks her best friend, who was the only one who new about the situation, for her opinion on it. Generic_Name gives her thoughts but doesnt seem to care much about it. Generic_Name doesnt bother asking anybody else. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can make a better choice because someone might have asked for the same advice before, there might be someone with more knowledge about it, and there is less stress on yourself on making a decision all on your own.

One reason you should ask for for multiple advice is because someone might have asked for the same advice before. For instance, Generic_Name is going through a breakup and she doesnt know what to do. She asks multiple people for their advice and a couple of them tell her they have been through the same thing then they give her their opinion on what they have done in the past. Since she asked more than one person for advice, she got results. Another example, when I was getting a pet for my birthday I had the choice of either getting a dog or a cat. I asked all my friends for their opinion about it and they all gave me the pro's and con's about each one since most of them had the same situation happen to them before. I ended up getting a cat because I was told it would be less expensive, less work to care for it, but be more fun to have. Since I got many opinions on my advice, I made the best decision and got better results.

Secondly, you should ask for multiple opinions for advice because there might be someone with more knowledge about it. For instance, Generic_Name is in an abusive relationship and her boyfriend cannot handle his anger so he takes it out on her and whenever she goes to work she always has to wear pants and a long sleeved shirt to hide her scars and bruises. She finally tells her co-workers about her situation, asks for their opinions and all of them tell her it isn't healthy to be in that relationship. She broke up with him and things started getting better from then on. Because she asked so many people about it and they seemed to know much more than she did, her life was much better and safer. Another example, when Generic_Name was asking a question on a math problem she asked one person for help and they gave her an answer but when she asked the teacher about it, she got the question wrong. She then on started asking multiple people for answers on her math homework and most of them would give her the right answers. Since other people had better knowledge than her, she got her math homework answers correct.

Lastly, you should ask multiple people for their advice because it would be less stress on yourself for making a choice on your own. For instance, Generic_Name has been very depressed lately and is deciding if she should run away. She tells her friends at school and they give all their attention on her and tell her that it isnt right so she should stay. It helps Generic_Name a lot since she is not the only with the weight of that decision and she decides to stay because she trusts her friends. Eventually things turn around for her and she is back to her normal, happy self. Since she didnt have all that weight of her decision all to herself, she didnt feel as stressed. Another example, when Generic_Name's parents were getting a divorce she had to decide whether to live with her mom or dad. Its stressful enough that she has to choose between two people she loves. She asks multiple friends and some of her counselors about what she should do and each one of them help her out. Since she is getting help from so many people she feels less stressed about her decision making. Getting multiple opinions on something could make decision making less stressful.

Generic_Name comes home one one day after school and as soon as she walks in she sees books being thrown at her dad from her mom. Generic_Name quickly shuts the door, grabs her bike and heads to the mall. She sees her friend group at the mall and joins in. They're exited to see her and they hang out. Generic_Name is debating whether to tell her friends about whats happening at her house. She finally gathers up the courage and asks her friends about it. They seem shocked at first because they didnt know about it, other than Generic_Name, but they start telling her about their opinions on it. One of her friends went through something similar and tell Generic_Name what she did and how it will have a better outcome. all her friends say that she should choose to be with another family because it will have a better outcome. Generic_Name feels less stressed about the situation since shes not the only one having to choose a choice all by herself and she trusts them about it because they have more knowledge about it. After spending her whole afternoon at the mall, she rides her bike home. She enters her house and still sees her parents arguing. She takes a deep breath and interrupts them. She tells them about her decision. 3 years later Generic_Name is living in a house that never has anybody arguing and has two new parents that love her. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice can make a better choice because someone might have asked for the same advice before, there might be someone with more knowledge about it, and there is less stress on yourself on making a decision all on your own.",109,23,0.6515,0.216,0.978,0.4122,0.5561,22.566,464,527,"[3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 0, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1]",10,4.1823
23724,"With daily advances in technology, the education system is shifting towards a more modern approach: going online. Students are no longer opening their textbooks, but now it's their laptops that are cracking open. While online school seems to be full of positives, the negatives such as the social aspect of school missing, the escape from at-home problems that students rely on school for, and the inconsistency of technology are some big red flags opposing the switch.

Generic_Name's school has turned completely online. She is halfway through high school, and the new and sudden change is drastically effecting her. Now that her curriculum is online she is not able to see her friends during school, and the lack of social interaction is starting to effect her mental health. She feels depressed, but does not want to draw attention to herself for ask for help because she feels like she has no one anymore. School is more than math class, and English projects. School is a way for students to connect with other people.

Generic_Name spends most of his days out of the house away from his computer. Since Generic_Name has no one to check up on him to make sure his assignments get done he simply does not complete them. Generic_Name is now in danger of not graduating. He has an IEP plan, that, while he physically went to school, granted him a teacher's aide in all of his classrooms. He formed a close bond with that teacher and the teacher helped keep him on task. Generic_Name now spends his time on other things, like leisure activities and seeing his friends. Students who need extra help would not find online school beneficial, and it would be difficult for them to keep up with their intrinsic motivation to learn without that extra push from an outside source. School itself is mentally taxing, but can provide a physical escape for students as well.

Generic_Name is the oldest of five , and has to share a room with her younger sister. They often fight and bicker and sometimes Generic_Name just needs a break. She often will go to a friends house, but her biggest escape is school. Being away from all the drama at home for hours at a time really helps Generic_Name, and helps her reset before spending the evening with her siblings . She is calmer and more patient with her siblings when she goes to school. But Generic_Name's county has shifted all the schools to online, and all day Generic_Name has to help her siblings with homework questions and looking after them all. Whether their home life is great or not so great it is a way to just leave the house and expel energy.

Generic_Name and his father do not get along very well. Generic_Name is an only child, and his mother is not in his life. His father takes out a lot of his frustration out on Generic_Name, ad Generic_Name loathes being at home. Normally he would spend as much time as he could away from his house, participating in after-school clubs, coming into school early, and just going places with his friends. But now his school is online. So he is constantly inside of the area that gives him his stress and anxiety and it is not good for him. Generic_Name feels as if he is walking on pins and needles all the time. School is a get away for students. Having school online does not work for every family dynamic.

Problems at home are not always with another person, rather they could be with technology.

Generic_Name spilled creme soda all over his laptop. His computer is out of commission for a week and he has no way to complete his assignments or email his teacher to explain what is going on. Generic_Name has a test this week that is worth a very large percentage of his grade, and he needs to have his laptop to be able to do it. This problem will cause Generic_Name's grade in the class to drop dramatically if his laptop is at the repair shop. Technology is too inconsistent to rely on outside of the classroom on a large scale.

Generic_Name's family cannot afford for her to have her own personal laptop. Her schooling is now being conducted only online however, and she is having difficulties keeping up with her schooling. She relies on the public library for computer access, but it isn't always open when she needs it to be, and she cannot video chat with her professors there. Generic_Name's grades are plummeting but she feels like she has no control over the situation. She has decided to get a job in order to pay for her own laptop, but her job drastically cuts into her schooling. She needs the hours to acquire the laptop but her balance between work and school isn't working and she doesn't know what to do.

Switching to online school can cause new stress on students.

Some could argue that online school could be beneficial to students by ways transportation. In climate weather, over crowding in schools, and just day to day traffic causes back-ups and problems in students getting to school on time. Students wake up late, and are caught up with adults trying to make it to work or miss the bus and must ask a parents for a ride. However making it necessary for children to come to school teaches students independence and self-reliance, clears all distractions away from students by having them sit in a classroom, and allows time for students to ask teachers questions about topics that they do not understand before class begins, giving the student one-on-one time. Having students stay home, gives them no accountability besides to themselves, which does not guarantee attendance to school. Students can sleep in, not turn on their computers and no one is there to check them.

Having school online would not be beneficial to students. Children's needs are to diverse and learning styles so drastic that to conform the millions of students in the U.S. alone to one way of learning is unrealistic and unhelpful. Children need the peer-to-peer interaction, the escape from their households, and the constituency of resources that school provides. Personal learning tailored to every student works best for equal education for every child, not having them stuck behind a screen.",178,20,0.798,0.3041,0.9722,0.4444,0.5666,20.8929,494,552,"[1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 0, 1, 5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]",0,4.2974
25758,"I had a guilty feeling in my stomach all morning. After I woke up to that text last night I instantly knew that this day was not going to be good. I should have never done what I did but it happened and I can't take it back. I got caught and now I have to do the right thing. I whip out my phone and press the face time button to talk to my best friend about what is going on. ""Hey Generic_Name."" I managed to say while holding back tears, ""I really need your advice on something."" I say more serious now but facing the camera towards the ceiling. ""Okay, what's up?"" She replies sounding concerned. ""I talked about Generic_Name behind her back with a few other people and I said some pretty hurtful things. The only reason I said those things is because everybody else was and I don't know."" I start rambling and need to slow down. ""Anyways she messaged me this morning saying that she found out what I said and it really hurt her feelings. Now I feel awful and I need your advice on how to apologize."" I squeaked. ""Were the other girls talking bad about her too?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Yeah, even worse than me."" I yelp. ""That's not what I heard."" She starts but I cut her off short, ""Wait what? You already heard about this?"" She chuckles while managing to say, ""Yeah, almost everybody has heard, but they said it was just you being mean and I believe them."" I can feel the tears streaming down my face as I end the call without replying to her. People should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because it will not be as bias, they might not know any better than you, and you can hear from people who have different meaning in your life.

First off, you should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because the advice will not be as bias. When you seek advice from someone you want to know what they would do in your shoes, but sometimes they might not tell you the full truth because they are bias. For example, my little brother, Generic_Name, really wanted a monster truck for his birthday. He decided to ask his friend if that is what he should ask for just so that he doesn't regret it. Well, it turns out that his friend also really wanted a monster truck but his birthday wasn't for months. So his friend told him not to ask for it because he would regret it but the real reason is because he didn't want Generic_Name to get it first. This is why you should seek more than one opinion because the person you ask for help might not actually want to help you, just themselves. For instance, my neighbor, Generic_Name, went on a trip to Hawaii with her friends. While she was there she got into an argument with one of them and she felt really bad afterwards. So she asked a different friend named Generic_Name what she should do. Generic_Name said that she should quit worrying as much and not do anything for the friend she was arguing with. Little did Generic_Name know that Generic_Name didn't like the friend she argued with which is why he told her not to do anything about it. Luckily, Generic_Name was smart enough to ask another friend who said she should get the friend flowers. Generic_Name decided to get the flowers and they made up. This is just example of why you shouldn't just ask one person for advice. They could be completely bias and you wouldn't even notice.

Next, you should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because the person might not know any better than you. Picture this, Generic_Name is in Hawaii with her friends and they came across a cliff that lead into the water if you jumped off. Most of her friends convinced Generic_Name to go first. Right when Generic_Name was getting ready to jump one of her friends stopped her and said they would go check the water first to make sure there weren't any rocks. Turns out, there were tons and that could have seriously injured Generic_Name if she had listened to her other friends. Her friends did not want her to get hurt, they just didn't know any better. A further example is when my mom went to get groceries and forgot what kind of yogurt we get and called me to check. I asked my little brother to do it for me and he said it was the Light and Fit brand and it was organic. So that is what I told my mom. I decided to double check to be sure and found out that it was also gluten free so I immediately told my mom the correct kind. Now this would have resulted poorly because my dad is allergic to gluten and he eats that yogurt a lot. Once again sometimes people aren't trying to give you bad advice or make you do the wrong thing they just do not know any better which is why you always should have multiple opinions.

Finally, you should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice so you can hear from people who have different meaning in your life What I mean by this is when you really need advice and nobody is available besides a peer you barely talk to than their advice will not have enough meaning or importance to even consider what they are saying. For instance, If they tell you that they think you were in the wrong, you might think that they don't even know you that well so why would they be right. Even if they are right about you being wrong. Which is why you have to hear multiple opinions. If you just hear from that person that doesn't have meaning in your life you will only agree with them if you like what you are hearing. Rather than if you talk to your older sister about it and they say that you are in the wrong you are way more likely to consider that and believe it. Studies show that 9 out of 10 people say they would always believe a best friend over a coworker no matter what the situation is.

In conclusion, I decided to ask my friend Generic_Name for advice because she doesn't go to my school and won't be as bias. She told me I should apologize to Generic_Name and tell her the full truth. Generic_Name thanked me and cleared up everything. People should seek multiple opinions when in need of advice because it won't be as bias, they might not know any better than you, and you can hear from people with different meaning in your life. ",149,26,0.7029,0.2536,0.9733,0.4202,0.5574,19.6615,471,595,"[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 5, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]",48,3.8865
4753,"Without a doubt, the blaring ring of the bell on the last day of school is the most awaited day of the year for students. The idea of pool parties, beach vacations, and sleepovers with friends every single day, instantly widens smiles; however, the very thought of having to complete an assignment given by a teacher, especially one with a bland topic, can turn even the widest smiles upside down. It is common for many schools to give a mandatory summer project for students as a way to ensure that they continue to engage in the learning process. These teacher-designed projects do not take into consideration the learning interests of students and instead can make, what should be an exciting and thought-provoking activity, feel like a chore. Student-designed summer projects will give students flexibility in finding a topic, incline them to complete the task, and allow for increased creativity as they work on the assignment over the course of summer.

In any type of project, regardless of subject, the topic for which it revolves around is significant as the student is basing their whole assignment on it. When a project is assigned by a teacher, it is typically general with no varying levels of depth, making it increasingly difficult for students to want to explore further. My older brother, Generic_Name, during the summer of his sophomore year in high school, was told to work on a biological inquiry with a topic of his choice. He has always been fascinated by the form and function of the human body, particularly with the nervous system. Generic_Name decided, after seeing a documentary on left and right brain, that he wanted to investigate the effects on the human body if the connection between them was severed. On the other hand, Generic_Name, his best friend, has a great interest in understanding the origins of different species and how they have evolved over time. Without hesitation, Generic_Name knew that he wanted to keep evolution as the focus of his research, which is a contrast to Generic_Name's investigation on the human brain. Even with their differences, both topics are in relation to biology with each suited to the student's interests. With the goal of a summer project being to encourage students to learn, this is only achieved if the topic chosen has a meaning to the person.

Once a topic that is engaging to a student's field of study is chosen, the completion of the assignment will be enjoyable and unlike a chore, which is common in teacher-designed projects. Generic_Name's interest of the human brain can be connected to a black hole; his mind will keep sucking in knowledge from research, and he will not stop pondering about various explanations to the independent actions of the brain when the connection between the two sides is lost. In contrast, Generic_Name would not do such a project even if he was given an incentive. Similarly, Generic_Name could not even force himself to learn about embryological origin and evolutionary history, which is a topic Generic_Name could spend hours learning about. Essentially, when a student selects a topic that they are passionate about, the motivation to learn about the subject comes naturally.

When it comes to designing a project, the possibilities are endless, with many decisions to make about the most effective way to showcase it. Instead of writing a ten paged paper on his investigation, Generic_Name could not contain his excitement on his findings and made the decision to create a human simulation. This simulation was set up at the local library, where different people would come to Generic_Name's booth and take a variety of exercises that utilize both the left and right brain. These activities included having the participants simultaneously draw a circle with their right hand and a square with their left hand, which they rendered as impossible. He then had them cover one of their eyes and requested for the participants to complete certain tasks specific to either the left or right brain. If given a topic by a teacher or asked to design a creative presentation of results to Generic_Name's topic, Generic_Name would not have been able to complete it with as much enthusiasm or have retained any of the knowledge. He was able to think outside of the box due to him having creative control over the project, which paved the direction it took.

Even with the plethora of benefits to student-designed projects, there is an argument for teacher-designed projects being more essential to student learning. Student-designed projects have been countered by many, detailing that they are very time-consuming and stray away from crucial learning targets since each student is focusing on a different topic. Although this rationale is reasonable, the goal of a summer project is to ensure that the student is learning about a topic they are interested in. A summer project is not to teach students any concepts; it is more so for them to take what they have learned and develop an application to it. By allowing students to find a topic that is best suited to their passions, they are given the freedom to extend their knowledge to the best of their ability and the encouragement to really engage in the learning process.

Overall, the importance of a student-designed project comes from its value in motivating students to further their knowledge on a topic that they are genuinely interested in. With having no restrictions in picking a topic, students can enjoy researching and learning as well as increase their capabilities in both, without it feeling like a task that needs to be completed and cannot be evaded. Not only will this motivate students to examine what fields of study they are interested in, it can also open their minds to creating complex questions and intricate explanations to them, which a teacher-designed project lacks as it is catered to everyone at a standard level of difficulty. Through designing their own project, students are exposed to and deeply involved in the different parts of the creative process, which is key to their learning. ",145,13,0.8354,0.2582,0.9761,0.4459,0.5688,31.7143,473,520,"[3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 5, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 1, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 6, 5, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 4, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]",1,4.564

""Go to the college i went to, George Mason. It is totally great, it has 24 hour food places on campus, nice people, and plenty of stores near it. You would love it there."" Replied her mom.""Ugh mom! That wasn't helpful because I have no clue where to go, and those where all bias, and now I don't know what to believe. I need more opinions."" Asking more than one person is a very helpful, and good idea because it will help you receive valid advice, advice that isn't bias, and advice from people who truly want the best and wont sabotage you.

If you ask many people for advice, you will get many different answers. First off, some of the advice a person may receive can be based upon true facts, that the person giving advice has discovered. While on the other hand, others will give you opinionated advice, based upon what they believe, and with no prior knowledge. This can result in you thinking something is true and very good your whole life, just to come to find out it is not. For example, my sister,Generic_Name, is an all-star cheerleader who is very skilled and has tons of knowledge when it comes to cheer leading, but this wasn't the case when she started out. She had no clue what cheer shoes to get, and what the difference from a cheer shoe, and a regular shoe was. She asked our mom, who said just get any shoe, it won't really matter, but Generic_Name waited to find out more information. She went to her first day of practice and asked around, her teammates and coaches knew she was flexible and tiny, so they knew she would be a flyer. Some people recommended shoes meant for tumbling, because they knew it would make it harder for her to fly and that they could replace her, which was totally rude and invalid advice, but most people recommended a shoe from a brand named Infinity. The shoes name was Flyte, a cheer shoe meant for flyers, She got the shoe, and it helped her immensely. This is one example as to why asking many people will help you receive better information. Another time, Generic_Name, my moms friend, was trying to go to a beach for vacation. My mom told her to go to the outer banks, because thats what she would choose. Generic_Name asked around throughout the neighbor hood, and found out that most people like Sandbridge, so thats where she booked her vacation. When she got there it was packed to the brim with people and umbrellas, smelled like smoke, and the sand was contaminated with burnt, gross cigarette buds, and litter. She realized that everyone she asked had not really been to the beach much, and actually went other places. This is another example as to why people should make sure to ask people who you trust, but ask more than one.

Secondly, advice given can be totally untrue, and bias. For example, when Generic_Name, my oldest sister, was trying to find a hotel she asked her one friend, who had visited the area before. Her friend told her you got to an Inn Called Holiday Inn. Generic_Name trusted her friends advice and went to the Holiday Inn. It ended up being terrible. It smelled bad, was moldy, and had no wifi. When Generic_Name got back she asked her friend why she would do that. Her friend said that her dad was the owner of the hotel and that she just wanted her dad to have an extra customer, which was completely bis. Generic_Name never trusted her advice again. This is another reason why you can't always trust everyone.

Sometimes their advice is completely bias. Another time this happened was when Generic_Name, Generic_Names twin, was applying for college. He asked his guidance counselor what college she recommended, she said James Madison. He had no clue where to go and hadn't looked for places with his intended major. He went to

James Madison, and tried to major in IT, ad they didn't have an IT program. He had to switch his major to psychology, and went back to ask why she recommended that school, knowing he was majoring in IT. She said she had no clue if it had IT or not but that she went there. He was really mad at his counselor, and never asked just one person again, knowing it could be a completely bias opinion.

Lastly, asking advice from people who arent trying to beat you in something, or who truly want the best for you is a vary good thing. Generic_Name, my friend, is a dancer, and in dance if you are competing, and a piece of clothing such as a hat, or a big piece of decoration on the out fit falls off, you will lose a lot of points and most likely lose the competition. When she was making her out fit for her Ariel themed dance, she asked her friend, also her top competitor, what to get to make bubble, and what fabric to use. Hey friend recommended a fabric that ripped easily, and a plastic to use for bubbles, which was really heavy, and would shatter it dropped. In Generic_Names dance, her shirt ripped on the shoulder, where the bubble where, in the middle of a twisty jump. The bubbles came crashing down, splattering all over that place after breaking into a bunch of fragments. She was disqualified, and her friend won the competition. Another time, my mom asked her friend how to make brownies, for the baking competition. Our neighbor really wanted to win and gave her a recipe that had lemon extract and baking soda, rather than vanilla extract, and baking powder. My mom ended up coming in last place. This is why it is a good idea to make sure your not asking advice from competitors.

In conclusion it is very important to ask many people, In doing so, you will receive advice from many people, and and there is a better chance of there being someone more educated on the advice sought, non-bias information, and someone with non-sabotaged information. Therefor, the information you receive isn't from just one person, who may not be well educated, who may be bias, and who may not truly want the best in you.",136,21,0.7325,0.205,0.9624,0.4383,0.5603,20.3175,512,607,"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 4, 0, 1, 5, 0, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]",14,3.893
23450,"Has there ever been a day where you have not learned? The answer to that question is no, not really. Learning is a process that everyone goes through, knowingly and unknowingly. It differs upon each individuals preference as to the way they learn. Schools offering the option of distance learning is beneficial to students as they can work at their own pace, they can work anywhere and anytime, and some students learn better when by themselves.

Allowing a student to understand the material at their own speed is imperative. Giving them this opportunity enables them to comprehend the content better. When in school, students tend to feel rushed when taking harder classes due to the faster pace. As a result, some students choose not to take challenging classes even when they can given a little more time. Two of my friends took AP Economics their freshman year in high school. Generic_Name took the course online and Generic_Name took it at school. The only difference was that Generic_Name had the entire year to finish the assignments whereas Generic_Name had to go by her teacher's deadlines. Generic_Name would sometimes complain about the fast pace or that she should not have taken the course. At the end of the year, they both had to take an AP exam, final assessment, and give a brief presentation on the major topics where they were asked a few application questions. Generic_Name had gotten a better score on both the exams. For the presentation, Generic_Name was not able to answer the application questions as she did not know how to apply the concepts she had learned. Given those circumstances, it was proven that Generic_Name did better as she understood the material better going at her own pace. She was able to convey the information more in dept than Generic_Name, making it apparent that the pace was the winning factor.

Students can finish work from anywhere and at anytime when given the option of distance learning. On some days, individuals just cannot focus on what they are learning. Attending classes from home allows one to give themselves a brain break and a chance to regain their focus, which cannot be done when in school as students are expected to attend class one after the other. Giving a break in between of learning content is important as it lets one understand the content better. Along with this some people have to take emergency trips to another country or simply cannot attend school for various reasons. The ability to take classes online resolves this issue as it enables one to still be able to learn the content regardless of being at school or not. Along with this, it prepares an individual for college as colleges have different timed classes and are not like traditional length high school classes. My sister took an online class over the course of a year for the first time her junior year in high school. It took her a little while to get used to as she was used to the traditional styled high school classes. her teacher would video conference with her at different times of day than a regular high school schedule. Once she graduated high school, she went to college and had a fairly new experience. She said that her experience with the online class prepared her well for college. It gave her exposure to the college styled classes and let her get the experience of learning the content on her own and then having the teacher help her with anything she wasn't sure about.

Many students prefer to work independently and find that they work better when alone. They are able to focus more and be more attentive. When in school, one is most likely to have friends in their classes or people that they can talk to and work with. Those people can cause distractions and take away from an individual's learning process and ability to comprehend the information. Attending classes at home allows one to complete their work without any distractions as one is working independently online or video conferencing with their teacher. Along with this, it allows an individual to have more attention by the teacher as there are far less people taking the class via video conference than people taking it in school. It enables one to get more one on one attention. In my AP physics class, I tend to get distracted as I talk with my friends that I have in that class. After when we are asked to do a problem for practice, I am only able to do half of it because I lose concentration resulting in the decrease of my ability to comprehend the information. When I am at home, I review the material on my own and work independently. Once I have reviewed, I am able to do that same problem again completely along with other problems. It's more effective to learn a topic when working alone.

Some may argue that a students ability to learn a concept can be slowed down due to technological issues. The weakness in that is students in school usually learn through the use of computers or smart boards and rarely through the use of whiteboards. When the internet goes down, either way students are deprived of their learning as there is almost nothing to do without it. When attending classes online, the time missed due to the technological issues can be made up with the use of an extra hour or so another day. However, that fix would not work when attending school as that is not allowed. Students attending school would miss that amount of information or get held behind by having to learn that information the next day rather than the new topic. When there are technological issues, there are very few efficient approaches to solve the issue at school.

Imagine having to cram for a unit test, study for three quizzes, and four other assignments in one night. Stress level being at about 10, getting no sleep, and drinking four cups of coffee just to stay awake. A nightmare with an easy solution being the option of distance learning with self pacing to finish courses over wide range of time with no stress and plenty of sleep.

24098,"Distance learning has become a worldwide phenomenon to parents and guardians as well as educators as they begin to navigate through the vast advancements in technology and the several opportunities available to future students to ensure happiness and prosperity at least once in their lifetimes. Most parents do not take the time to consider and realize that this type of learning is actually increasingly becoming popular over time. Distance learning teaches students to nurture their talents and skills while learning to find an interest in a career pathway. Across the numerous nations around the world, future generations of students are noted to benefit from distance learning because it allows a student to delve into their own learning and apply it to the real world as well as provide an insight behind the true meaning of responsibility while learning to form the correct work ethics necessary for success.

Distance learning from home allows the student to understand the material taught by the educator more than in a typical classroom environment by submerging into the detailed gist of all things while making connections to the real world through the hands-on activities and resources available to ones' own fingertip. For example, Generic_Name, a current junior in high school, is able to understand her trigonometry course and the vital means behind the formulas through a classroom activity of calculating the heights of several trees and buildings around her neighborhood. The activity that Generic_Name proudly completes demonstrates her understanding of the unit through a submitted presentation and a sheet of paper with her calculations proven correct. Through the activity handed to Generic_Name, she has gained a new skill that could be beneficial for her in the future if she decides to pursue a career in architecture or math. With this in mind, she would have not learned how to use that entire course load of information if she had attended a regular math class at the nearby high school. In a normal classroom environment, she would have been taught the material and the usage of the formulas like any other student in the county as well as have been asked to demonstrate her understanding through an exam, which does not really show that she understands the material to the fullest potential. Moving further along, Generic_Name, another high school student within the state of Virginia, has also displayed his passion and desire for his favorite course, Earth Science, through various field trips to the lake and pond near his house. Through distance learning, Generic_Name understands the material through the readings and labs at the comfort of his home. The labs allow him to be on the search for specific animals and rocks, which further peaks his interest about the environment. Without the course load available to him within his reach, he might have not had found his passion and the available opportunities to excel in that area. Distance learning plays a major role in the future of these students by building up the necessary skills and desire to pursue a dream.

Furthermore, the availability to learn and take courses from the comfort of your home opens up the opportunity for the student to learn the real meaning behind responsibility that comes along with taking these courses in this manner as well as the ability to correct any bad work ethics before heading to the workforce in the near future. An individual that exemplifies the benefit of distance learning is Generic_Name, a commuter college student, living in Generic_City with his two parents. For the most part, Generic_Name takes his classes online to ensure that all of his graduation requirements are met with the degree he aspires to receive in education. One of his teachers had assigned an activity to him that involved a visit to an elementary school in the area. Back in high school, he would have made the decision to slack off and turn the assignment a day later than the original due date, but things have changed for the better as he entered college. His online class has allowed him to go at his own pace accordingly to a deadline. He would receive absolute no credit for a late assignment in college, and often times, Generic_Name would now make the decision to ensure that all things are turned in. Generic_Name understood the responsibility behind his course load and visiting the several elementary schools as a teacher aide; after all, he would contribute his time to assist the little kids that were eager to learn. Working with kids for his assignment has given Generic_Name an insight into the type of teacher he would become. Generic_Name, a twenty-year-old college student in nursing, has tremendously seen the change as well in her work ethic. She used to keep her thoughts all to herself, but with the help of her online nursing class, she was able to openly express her opinions in class discussions as well as live lessons. She has successfully skyrocketed and almost reached her full potential because of distance learning. Distance learning has taught her valuable life lessons that she will forever be grateful for. It has taught her to be open and responsible to her patients at all costs. Success can be found from the comfort of your home through online classes.

Thousandths of students that actively involve themselves in distance learning has demonstrated a strength in building responsibility and vital work ethics as well as connecting their course load to the real world in hopes of truly finding a passion. Taking responsibility for ones' own actions while ensuring that tasks are done in a correct manner is critical in the workforce of today. In addition, it is also important that the individual finds joy in learning as they get older, and applying that new information to their work or lives on a day-to-day basis. Education is both found and reached in many ways possible; at last, all individuals should continue to stay curious and keep searching for that never ending desire to learn more little by little. ",201,11,0.8962,0.347,0.9828,0.4879,0.5883,31.5882,508,541,"[3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2]",0,4.7048
23910,"Some people would say that it is the heavy cost of a social life to take classes online instead of going to a traditional brick and mortar school. They believe that by taking online classes, people are less equipped in dealing with face-to-face interactions in the real world when the time comes. However, these people also fail to consider that there are flaws in brick and mortar schools which can burden those who prefer an option of taking classes online instead. Although some may believe otherwise, it would heavily benefit students to be able to attend classes at home because there are some people who prefer not being in a physical classroom, there are less cases of missing class from emergencies, and there are more flexibilities given to students.

One reason why students would benefit to attend classes from home is if they have limited social skills and they are not comfortable with vocally situating themselves in a physical classroom. A personal situation which displays this is my cousin Generic_Name, who decided to take online classes starting his first year of middle school due to his severe anxiety since 4th grade which made it hard for him to interact with other students since he was younger. His anxiety also impacted him since it became more difficult with concentrating and asking for guidance from teachers, in fear of them judging him for it. However, after finishing his first year of online school, Generic_Name had claimed that by taking his courses online, he felt more comfortable in pursuing help from his teachers in courses he struggled with and concentrate without thinking about the impending presence of other students. If Generic_Name had not taken online courses for his schooling and had gone to a brick and mortar school instead, he would have felt more miserable since that was where he would have been forced to have physical interactions in order to resolve his academic problems and the stress it brought to him would also hinder his ability to learn.

Another reason why it would positively impact students to take online courses from the comfort of their homes is because there are less likely scenarios of a student missing their classes from any kind of emergency. A case which exemplies this is from another cousin, named Generic_Name, who is currently taking his school courses online admist the epidemic of the corona virus. The corona virus, which wildly spread in his hometown of Generic_City, prompted his school district to take measures in making students continue their academic courses online without the risk of exploiting students in schools where a virus is likely to spread. By making the decision for students to continue classes through online means instead, there are less chances of Generic_Name's school district of possibly extending the school year to make up for all missed days. Without the option of being able to attend classes from home, both Alex and his school district would have been negatively affected by the epidemic from possible delays in schools to a higher chance of catching the virus. Another person who illustrates why attending online courses prevents missing class for emergencies is from a situation my childhood friend Generic_Name had two years ago, when her older sister Generic_Name, who lived in Generic_City, got into a heavy car accident and Generic_Name and her single mother sponantiously made plans to go visit her since Generic_Name could not stay home alone. However, since Generic_Name had been taking her academic courses online, it did not make it hard for her to catch up on her work because all she really needed was a computer and there was no need for her to be in a physical classroom to participate. By being able to take her classes by ways of online, Generic_Name's school work did not heavily interfer with the sudden emergency and she had the flexibility of doing her work no matter where she was.

Lastly, it would be beneficial for students to be able to take classes online because it gives more flexability to students with a busy personal life. For instance, Emma Chamberlain, a popular YouTuber known for her witty persona, had dicussed in a video that she decided to take her junior high school year through online classes because she wanted to focus on her rising career. Her decision to do so was very intelligible in the end, given the fact that she mainly filmed videos throughout the day and frequently traveled across the U.S. due to job opportunites and sponserships from brands. Without the flexibility given to her from online classes, Emma would not be able to do what she constantly does today which would mean having less time in being able to film her videos and seeking out her passions of being a prominent figure in YouTube. Another person who illustrates this is my same friend Generic_Name, who had a demanding part time job at a cafe during the morning of school weekdays in order to finacially support her family. Since she took her academic courses online, she was able to have a flexible shift and work for longer hours because there was no given time that she had to be present in class. If she had not been doing school through online means, it would not have been possible for her to take on the job at an hour where most students are actively learning in school.

Although some people make it seem taboo that attending classes online is an option a person would rather take than a tradional school, there are clearly a lot of positive aspects of deciding on taking one's classes online. By choosing to not take a traditional school, an individual is able to focus more than just their academic life and able to take on more opportunites that most likely would not be given if it were not for this barrier. Also, attending classes online pushes a person on being more independent because it is ultimately all on them to juggle with their own academic and personal life. Although attending classes online might not be for everyone, it goes to show that there are many benefits one can take from it.",149,20,0.7633,0.2752,0.9831,0.4718,0.582,39.2143,505,550,"[2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 0, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1]",3,4.5701
24224,"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always.

Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes.

Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school.

Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.

In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more",178,5,0.9454,0.29,0.99,0.4653,0.5821,24.8298,511,582,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2]",6,4.2177
4221,"There are some individuals who attend school everyday and do not apply themselves, now imagine if it was summer time and they were given the task to design a project for themselves. When the next school year begins it would be a lot of zeros that would have to be put in! With teachers creating a summer project it allows students to not only use creativity but it gives them motivation and challenge as well. Normally when teachers create assignments they put a lot of thought into it so that the student would have to think and be really creative. The goals of the projects during the summer are: to keep the students brain stimulating, for them to put the knowledge that they have gained the previous year to use, and to also prepare them for what could be coming the next year. Teachers should create the summer projects because it gives students a challenge, prevents them from getting distracted, and requires them to retain knowledge rather than plagiarizing.

Have you ever done an eight thousand piece puzzle? well, some teacher given projects are just like that. When people do puzzles it requires concentration, motivation, and interest. If students were to create their own project it is possible that he/she would not be as motivated or interested in it. If he/she isn't interested in it it's possible that he will/she will take the easy way out. Like puzzles, projects can be challenging and requires out of the box thinking. With teacher given projects students brains are still being stimulated and they are getting in a from of studying as well. Not only would the project be challenging the student to put forth their best work it would also be allowing them to get extra research in on the topic especially if they are interested in it.

When they do their research they get to analyze information that they may not have known about before. With gaining more knowledge than they left the previous school year with they are entering another school year with more new and fresh knowledge as well.

Summer time is the time that students take to relax and to hang out with their friends. If they had to create a project over the summer it is very likely that they would not get it done. During the summer a lot of students do not like or want to stay focus, that is usually the time when their brains shut down. With the project being created by a student it is possible that they will just choose a topic without having any knowledge on it, without even doing research on it or having interest in it, therefore it would be pointless because they would not be learning anything nor would they be maintaining information that has been taught to them previously. Usually friends help motivate their friends to do positive things but it is not often that you see the students motivating other students to get their work done. It is more likely to see students motivating each other to practice for a sport or to make bad decision but it still is not likely to see a student motivating another student to do a self made project over the summer therefore, teachers should design them. For instance, Last summer Generic_Name and Generic_Name were assigned a project by Mrs. Generic_Name, Generic_Name didn't want to do the project because she said it was summer time and it was time for fun. The project that Mrs. Generic_Name gave really caught Generic_Name eyes, Generic_Name really enjoyed Mrs. Generic_Name class so Generic_Name couldn't wait to get started. Once Generic_Name saw how interested that Generic_Name was she immediately changed her mind and wanted to do Mrs. Generic_Name project immediately. Generic_Name influenced Generic_Name to do her project all by him enjoying Mrs. Generic_Name's class. There are many positive things that teachers can do or say that can affect if a student does the over the summer project or not.

Throughout the school year teachers give out a variety of classwork, test and quiz grades and there are students who show up to school approximately two days out of the week and still receive an one hundred on the work, how is that someone may say? Although it may not be everyone doing this there are some students who cheat off of other students or use Google to find the answers. With students creating their own project it is extremely likely that they will not come up with their own work, however it is likely that they will use a little creativity if the project is designed by a teacher. There are also some students who would not do the summer projects because they aren't motivated, if the teacher put a prize for the best project it could give students more motivation and make them want to do the best project that they can possible do. When students are cheating and plagiarizing they don't really read and understand what they are putting on their projects, typically they just write what they see and read without understanding. With teacher given projects they are different every time which is good because it prevents the students from going and attempting to find an old project that belongs to someone else that is the same way. The method that the teachers use for the summer project should be different every time.

In conclusion, i agree that teachers should design the summer time projects because it challenges the students by giving them a task and requiring them to be an out of the box thinker. Also because it motivates them to gather the best information and as much information as possible. It helps them keep old knowledge fresh and gather new knowledge as well to add to the things that they already know. With the teachers designing the project it is better because it makes the project a priority for the students to get done which also teaches them responsibility. There are a variety of lessons that could come from teachers designing the summer projects for the students which could lead to many positive outcomes. Summer projects are really afftective in many ways but they have better outcomes when they are designed and influenced by a teacher.",183,8,0.9162,0.3189,0.9813,0.4548,0.5744,27.925,479,536,"[2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 0, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 2, 5, 5, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3]",1,4.4637
4041,""" Generic_Name, are you not exited about summer vacation? I can not wait for my toes to be submerged in the crystal clear waters of Costa Rica!"" I said with excitement while Generic_Name looked over at me with a penetrating stare, ""what?"" I asked "" It's just that while you are at the beaches I have to be here, at home, doing my summer assignments"". Generic_Name brought up a good point, many schools in the United States require their students, or at least expect them to practice their acquired knowledge from the year throughout their summer vacations. These assignments can vary in description from online activities to summer long projects,consequently, bringing up the questions of who gets to design such tasks? Is it the students that ultimately are the ones completing the assignment, or is it the teacher?. Without a doubt, teachers should be the ones that design the assignments because they have more experience and know their students strengths and weaknesses.

Students should not design summer assignments, but instead teachers should because they have more experience from their teaching, learning, and experimenting throughout the years. Ms. Generic_Name is a dedicated science teacher in Generic_School, but she is also very found of summer assignments and does her best to make sure that they exemplify her knowledge to her students; furthermore, she has made it her goal to make sure that her assignments are useful and has taken classes outside of her field to make sure that they are. Continuously, Ms. Generic_Name teaches multiple classes in biology and genetics and is knows the topics that are important for students to know, therefore, her philosophy is to enforce those topics during the summer by giving students summer assignments. Lastly, she has gotten time to experiment like many other teachers have, and she knows what will work and what will not, so for her 90's class a summer long project worked because they were not unmotivated, but for her most recent class an online activity would fit best with their interest. That is why I believe that summer assignments need to be teacher design because they know how to design material that is unique to every one of their classes needs. Some people may disagree with the argument that students know what they need better because they know themselves, but their reasoning is flawed because students do not have the knowledge that teachers have gained from their hundreds of students and the years spent in college to learn how to teach. I my self was one of those students that thought that I knew how to teach my self, but I could not be further from the truth. The summer of seventh grade we were allowed to choose how we wanted to review, and it really was student designed, we could do whatever we thought would work, but when next school year came around I was in geometry and I had even forgotten how to find X. It just goes to show that students can not teach themselves. Lastly, Generic_Name a friend that attends the Generic_School agrees that having teachers design their summer assignments is great, but some professors do not assign summer assignments so its up to them to learn the material, and according to her it is clear that the students that had an assign assignment retained more information than those that were left on their own, Generic_Name even compared those unfortunate students to chickens running around with their heads chopped of, only that they had textbooks.

Teachers should design summer assignments because they have gotten to know how their students learn by being with them for almost every day for nine months. I would be lying if I said that I do not have a favorite teacher because I do, and almost every student will agree that they all have that one teacher that they feel comfortable with. Those teachers have the privilege to learn a little more from their students, but they do most of their learning in the classroom from everyone of their students, so they are able to apply their knowledge to their methods of teaching and how they assign work. Teachers are so well versed on students that they even know when their classes are not ready to take a test, my chemistry teacher knows us so well that she has postponed tests before because she knows that we had a hard time with the unit and listens to our concerns and conflicts. As a result, teachers are the best to understand students struggles and methods of learning. Although some may disagree, with retaliation on how a teacher can know everyone of their students on the basis of how the teacher has time or has the patience to do so, but the truth is that teachers spend an enormous amount of time with their students not only in class, but also after and before school. Ms. Generic_Name is one such teacher that is here before and after school, and I had never realized the amount of people in the mornings and the many more afternoon. These students got up early and gave up their afternoons to get help from her, so I do not see how she would not learn from the extra interaction with her students. Furthermore, sometimes it is the students themselves that express what they want their teachers to know, for I know I do anytime that I feel that the way the teacher is teaching something is to bizarre or to confusing I make sure they know it, and not only me but many of my classmates do too. In tenth grade my calculus teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, even made us know that all of our feedback and input was of importance to him and that he used it to make our summer assignment.

As a result from teachers designing student's summer assignments students will be able to learn and retain past and new information better. Students should not have the desire to design their own summer assignments when teachers have the knowledge both about students and material to design them. In past years these assignments have been common and they should not stop being such in the future when their main role is to help students, and is seen in the present. ",159,8,0.9042,0.284,0.9801,0.4284,0.5634,36.7419,455,507,"[0, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 3, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]",34,4.3766
841,"Cell phones have some way of taking our full individual attention for however long we allow it to. We become easily distracted and connected to our phones. People usually look at it just to look at it, without any notifications popping up, solely based on us humans being attracted to our phone. There also is that part of us using our cell phones to stay in the mix, see what's hot on Instagram, or if that hot guy or girl posted on Snapchat. There are many times and places you could multitask with your phone. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with because slip-ups while driving are very unforgiving. One minor mistake on the road can cause your life or someone else's life to be taken. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

Fatality is an occurrence of death by accident. Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (""On the Road).

Nearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). In 2016, 3,450 fatalities were caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). Also one out every four car crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Statistics). In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of others.

Texting and driving is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is the most common and dangerous thing you could do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk (""On the Road""). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is.

Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving""). Steering control while distracted is 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving"").

In 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distracted driving resulted in approximately 2,600 deaths in 2002 (""Texting while driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous). The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities (Masters, ""Texting While Driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous?). Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving drunk.

Texting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise. According to a group of researchers, they found that some kind of texting law leads to a 2.3% decrease in fatalities for all drivers. Specifically banning teen drivers from texting reduced traffic deaths in that group by 11 percent (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In conclusion, texting and driving could ultimately cause you unnecessary fees, or big time in prison.

In summary, drivers should know that they are dealing with something serious when driving a car. There are limited chances in life;texting and driving are pushing those chances away. Drive with the intent and purpose to get to your destination. Deal with texts after or before you drive, because it could cost you everything. Attention is highly needed when driving, there are split-second decisions to be made while driving and your phone distracts your attention enough to potentially cause accidents. Your reaction time is based on how early you see it, looking at a phone prohibits you from reacting. In conclusion, put your phone away while driving to save lives!

24806,"I believe asking for advice to multiple people is the best way to help you see all the options you have and do what's best for you. When people for ask advice they're looking for ways to help them decide or do something that their not sure what they decided on what's the best way to go. Advice is a lot of opinions , options , and ideas , all of those things can bring you to the best decision you can make but it could also be the worse decision of your life depending on who you listen to the most because not all advice is good. Which is why you should focus on what your asking advice for and from who are you asking advice to.

The good thing about asking advice is that it will give you the best opportunity to make the right decision. Its best to ask people who are close to you and know what kinda person you are. Family would probably the best choice because they grew up with you , know how you are, and know what's best for you .But If you don't have a family then you can ask a friend but make sure that your friend will not turn against you because if that happens the advice they give you can be a bad thing. If you don't knwo if your friend is a good person to ask from well you can compare the answer they give you from the one that your family gave you because friends are like family if your friend is truly your friend they will have kinda the same advice like your family did or even better. If you do that you will know that the answer your getting it's not just something random or unhelpful instead that its a good option to choose from.

Some people may think asking multiple people can be way too much pressure, and turn out to be a bad thing which sometimes can be true but you can always learn from those mistakes .

It will be a lot of pressure to have a lot of different opinions from different people but isn't having to make a decision alone and not having but one or two options to choose from already pressuring enough .

Maybe having more options will take some pressure off or it might add on to it but not everything is gonna be easy as pie .

I think getting advice from multiple people and some of them being bad advice will be a great thing because then you will see the difference between good and bad .

No one will ever learn anything by getting a few opinions from people and thinking there getting a better chance to get a good outcome out of that because is not all about them their decisions affects others too .

Thats why not only you have to think about yourself when asking for advice but also ask people who you know will be affected by the choice you make .

I have experience this before and let me tell you i wish someone said all of this to me back then. I had to make a decision between my boyfriend and my best friend. When me and my boyfriend started dating my best friend kept complaining that i hanged out more with him than her and that we barely see each other anymore, which was true. One day she told me i had to chose between them of who i wanted to be with because she wasn't gonna be waiting around for me to act like a friend. I thought it was dumb and she was way out of line but i had a few days to figure everything out. Of course i couldn't decide on my own so the only person i asked was one my other friends because she knew both my best friend and boyfriend. She told me if i was happy with my boyfriend that if my best friend is really my friend she should understand that and deal with it . I thought that made sense so thats what i told my best friend and she said ""i understand your happy with him but what is what i don't understand is why you have to be with him all the time, but i guess you made your decision"". Then she left before giving me a chance to say anything. I went home and started crying , my mom asked what was wrong and i told her everything that happened. She gave me some advice to what i should do and should've done and i started thinking that if i just would have asked my mom or anyone else for advice I wouldn't have lost my best friend. If that happened to me imagine of what other people been through or lost to just because they didnt ask other people for advice and didnt think they had many options.

In conclusion, seeking for advice to multiple people and get multiple opinions is the best choice you can make to make more better choices and not affect other people in a bad way. but doing that will not always turn out of be a good thing and it'll be okay because you still have the rest of your life to make up for it and get better at it .

In order of you to get a good outcome out of that will be to make sure your asking the right kind of people like family, close friends, teachers ,any adult you can trust. Also be sure to ask the best amount of people because having more than one option is always for the best. If you try to decide something hard by yourself and end up decide wrong it will not just effect your life but also the people around you and maybe some people you dont even know.

Maybe you dont want to ask because you dont want to involve other people to it but for all you know they can already be involve so why not risk it. If the decision your asking advice for needs to or you want it to be a secret and asking one or none for advice will keep it that way thats just selfish because every secrets are gonna get out in some point and if your decision will affect other people then it shouldn't be kept secret. Some people dont ask for help because they think it makes you look weak even if some people see it that way its not it will be stressful and a lot pressure but nothing in life is simple and you'll never know if having multiple opinions from people will make you feel relive and it will give you the best opportunity to make the better choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",141,18,0.7736,0.2819,0.986,0.405,0.5564,34.4286,459,516,"[1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]",39,3.8448

After that you open your eyes slower than a sloth, and notice there is three more people at the bus stop. You also notice that they're all wearing the same clothing from yesterday as well. In addition to that they also have baggy eyes and messy hair. You start wondering why we are all like that. The bus gets there and the bus driver honks at all of you for laying on the floor. Generic_Name ,your best friend leads the way onto the bus. ""Ya'll look like dirty slugs. are ya'll okay?,"" your bus driver, Ms Generic_Name asks in a high pitched voice. No one responds back. The whole bus ride is dead silent which gives you a chance to get some rest. ""Hey, Generic_Name have you finished the science homework,"" you ask with a sleepy toned voice. She responds, ""Yea, i spent all night doing it."" Those were the only words spoken during the entire bus ride. Once you got to school the principal greeted you and your fellow classmates with a wide grin. Walking down the hall was difficult because of the lack of energy in everybody. ""Hello class i hope everybody got more sleep than i did,"" your teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, mumbles. ""Today we will learn about the four comma rules. This is very important so pay attention."" Even with your teacher's warning you still zone out and wonder why your principal would make you all take an extracurricular activity when you already have so much to do. You start closing your eyes slowly trying to fight back the sleepiness, but you dont put much of a fight and you fall asleep. I disagree with the principal's decision because if we all had to participate in a extracurricular activity students wouldn't have time to do their homework, students would be stressed out, and would lead students to think they are disappointments.

First, one of the reasons I dont agree with the principle's decision is because students wouldnt have time to complete his/her homework. Students with AP classes already learn enough in one day and need time outside of school to complete assignment. Asking for good grades when having no time at home is like asking for superpowers. For example, imagine coming home from soccer and having seven classes worth of homework due the next day. In addition only having five hours to complete it. ""Sorry ma'am, but your son has lost 28 pounds and also has an eating disorder,"" the doctor says. Your mother responds with, ""But how can i get him to eat."" ""Im too busy to eat mom,"" you reply while working on a history project. The doctor looks at you with a worried look and says, ""Look kid you have to eat even if your too busy or else youll die!"" Your mom looks at the doctor and asks, ""He's been like this since he started soccer."" The doctor replies, ""Soccer? Is that why you don't have time?"" You have a flash back of when your principal announced that everybody will be taking an extracurricular class after school. ""Why dont you just drop out of soccer, then you will have more time after school,"" the doctor says. "" Because my principal is forcing us to take an extracurricular class and I have homework from every class, thats why Im too busy.""

Another reason that I disagree with the principals decision is because students will get stressed out. School can already be stressing enough and when you add better time managing, which activity you should take, and still getting enough sleep its asking for too much. Student will get stressed no matter what under those conditions. Stress can lead to many things like mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts. For example, you come home with a lot of homework to do. You run upstairs to get started on the homework. Hours later you finished three and need two more assignments to be finished, but its nine o'clock already.""eek,"" the door squeaks and your dad pops out and says, ""Hey, lights out, go to bed"" you reply with, ""OK dad, good night."" A couple of weeks go by and each day the same thing happens, you have to much work and such little time. One day your teacher puts down your report card and says, "" I might have to call your parents. You haven't been turning in your assignments"". You go home and show your parents the report card. They look at you with a disappointment look. This is another reason why I disagree with the principal. More and more of this happens you find yourself crying because you can't do anything and it seems like your life is on repeat. One day you Say to yourself, ""If I were gone out of this life no one would care in fact people would be happy, so then I would never disappoint them again."" You go on to tie a noose and hang yourself.

On a Wednesday morning, you wake up knowing you didnt do all of your work. You go to school tired. You get to class a bit late because you didnt feel like speed walking. ""Beep,"" the announcements come on, ""This is you principal speaking, from now on you will no longer be forced to do an extracurricular activity instead you will go home like you used to.""Suddenly a burst of energy rushes out of you and you shout in joy, you realize that you arent the only one. The whole school is shouting, some people are even going down on their knees and crying of joy. Weeks go by and you are back to your old self except you have an eating disorder and a bad sleeping habit. Once again you are getting good grades and you dont have anymore bad thoughts in your head. ""Congratulations, you made it to the AB honor role. we are so proud of you!"" your parents say in harmony. In conclusion, I disagree with what the principal has decided because if we all had to participate in a extracurricular activity students wouldn't have time to do their homework, students would be stressed out, and would lead students to think they are disappointments.",180,29,0.7225,0.2676,0.971,0.4649,0.5744,18.6618,538,659,"[1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 0, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 3, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 5, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 3, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5]",20,3.9157

Whether it's playing sports, participating in student council, school plays, or just painting in art club, all teens and students need that extra confidence, and adrenaline boost that extracurricular activities provide. Principle of Generic_School, Generic_Name, is proposing a new, controversial school rule that states, ""All students at BRMS

must participate in at least one extracurricular activity throughout the year."" Should his rule be enforced or shot down? If you were to compare the pros and cons, the answer is yes! Not only will this rule be beneficial to all of the students physical and mental health, but forcing kids to branch out and do extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person.

The first reason why . Generic_Name's rule should be enforced is pretty clear. By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not have signed up for on their own, they are forced out of their shell and meet new people who share similar passions. In a pole taken at Southern Utah Middle School, the students were asked approximately how many friends they had and generally how they met. The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, and etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don't only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that's 7 out of 10! Forming bonds with new people can help with trust and relationship issues and can all be done through simply being forced to branch out and participate in an extracurricular activity at your school.

Another meaningful reason for the students to be forced to enjoy extracurricular activities is because of their mental and physical health. World renown author of several New York Times awarded self-help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Steigerwald explains, ""Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too."" Steigerwald is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Engstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. He remembered, ""I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,"" he shuddered, ""Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind."" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after school on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle.

Having a clear head space has been proven to help with academics, and participating in extracurricular activities has proven to help clear your mind. In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. GPAs in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schools around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, ""Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and everyday the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it's vital for these college students."" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial.

Although it's pretty clear that Generic_Name's rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take SOLs and other tests. Do SOLs make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and ""pursuing happiness"" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, ""being happy"". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather then loners, who study, work, and text by themselves. This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier.

In the end, the rule should be passed and all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It will not only be beneficial for their mental health, happiness, and social life, but also for academics and physical activity. ",172,12,0.8696,0.2603,0.9718,0.4806,0.581,21.8077,506,580,"[2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 2, 1, 6, 4, 3, 3, 1, 5, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 5, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3]",9,4.448
4839,"Fourth period had just begun, and Generic_Name was desperately longing for its end; that afternoon, summer break would begin. Unfortunately, her school mandates that students complete a project over break, and, this year, a teacher had designed it. Once summer break had nearly reached its end, Generic_Name was struggling to complete the assignment; she was not sure how to develop the project, and her time was often limited due to her family. The debate over teacher and student designed projects has been long ongoing; this argument causes most schools to have no projects over summer break at all, thus hindering students education. Students should be able to design their own projects to complete over the summer, rather than a teacher, as it allows them to create their own schedules, better express themselves, and develop a different perspective regarding school.

By allowing students to design their own projects, schools are then allowing them to manage their own time. Summer is a time of year when students get a break. A young, developing mind requires this break in order to effectively process any information it has stored; information usually essential to the following years of a child's life. Without a designated period of time for the brain to full recuperate, the mind is likely to shut down, prohibiting it from registering anything whatsoever. Additionally, students have families, many of which plan events like vacations over the break. A student is unable to control the influence their family has on their life and that is no reason for them to be punished with a bad grade on their time-consuming assigned project. Time management is a valuable skill, and there is no better way to teach it than to allow students to create their own schedules.

Secondly, with students designing their own projects, they will be able to express themselves in a way that they could not with a mandatory topic to follow. If a student is allowed to design their own project then they are going to choose something they have interest in. This interest will not only be visible within their project, but it will also help the student to learn more in-depth about whatever topic they chose to do. Research shows that when a person is interested in something, its retaining of knowledge relating to the subject is 25% higher than average. Furthermore, a self-designed project would allow a student to showcase their overall creativity and imagination. Instead of every student in a class presenting an hour long slide show about the origin of man, there would be a variety of presentations and display models that, not just having intrigued its creator, capture the attention of multiple students, who can then learn information as well.

Adding to the argument, student-designed projects would cause a positive experience with education. Oftentimes, students do not understand that education is not just reading textbooks and writing essays; it is so much more than that. With students designing their own projects, they will be able to experience for themselves the wonders of the learning. If a student chose to do their project on a book, there would be an infinite number of possibilities. The student could choose to read a biography about a historical figure, but they could also choose to read a fantasy novel; either option will benefit the student in regards to education, but by having the student pick their project, they are deciding their method of learning, a method which they actually enjoy. Likely, with however the student chooses to do their project, the student will continue that way of educating themselves all on their own. Instead of dreading coming to school, the student will have realized that they love learning, just in their own way.

Regardless of all the benefits of student-designed projects, there will still be school boards that would argue against this method. They may argue that a teacher-designed project is more educational; these projects would make sure every student was informed of a topic that could then be discussed. However, this hopeful attitude towards teenage students is inaccurate because, although a discussion would be possible if all students were properly informed, students are unlikely to take the initiative to reach that level of dedication to a teacher-selected topic. Most students would have varying details of information and, although the communication of these details would result in a growing knowledge on the matter, most of them would probably be from an unreliable source and untrue, thereby confusing an entire class of students. Many students would also be unwilling to dedicate themselves to something they find entirely school-related, and this would result in a lack of effort and, potentially, a lack of participation; whereas, a topic the student enjoys could make the learning process significantly less stressful. Keeping the brain active could be as simple as learning new vocabulary from a song or looking up an animal that the news mentioned; school curriculum would not be required to keep students engaged.

In conclusion, having students design their own projects to complete over summer break has much greater benefits then forcing the completion of projects developed by teachers. With this method, students will be able to manage their own time, leading to increased productivity in their future. These students will then be able to learn to express themselves through their individual creativity and interests. Additionally, students will gain an overall positive experience with education, fueling their desire to learn more and participate with more enthusiasm in school. The world's most famous celebrities only got to where they are because they followed their interests, but the school system has a way of restricting those ideas. There is no better way to encourage someone to become successful than to give them the freedom of choice, especially in a school, where students set goals and learn how to reach them.",177,18,0.8154,0.312,0.9764,0.4677,0.5776,29.2973,490,518,"[2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 5, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]",0,4.6504
25970,"When needing advice due to a problem in life, people often go to someone to ask for advice and they generally go to multiple people to ask advice. For many people this can seem peculiar, going to multiple people for advice might seem point less to some, but when thought about, this method is a helpful way to make a better choice. By using the method of asking multiple people for advice, this could help someone make a better choice by doing this the person could see the problem from different perspectives, the person could get information that the other person asked didnt know, and there is the off chance that the person could be getting biased advice from the person without knowing. In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful and is recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with.

If a person has a problem, a challenge most have is seeing it from other's perspective, sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topic can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didnt mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someone else for advice then they wouldn't have realized that the friend was sorry and didnt mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice. Besides helping people look at their problem from a different perspective, talking to multiple people can still help people make better choices in other ways, they could get information from someone that the previous people that they talked to didnt know, and the information could help influence their decision.

When people have a problem they seek advice from those around them, a major reason to asking multiple people for advice is that one of the people that is asked could be someone who has information that the others didnt know, or withheld. For example, in a 6rd grade class there was a boy who had trouble in history class, there was a history test on the following Friday, the boy was worried so he asked his best friend, Generic_Name what he should do, Generic_Name told him not to stress and that to study and he'll be fine. He trusted his friend's advice but asked his other friend, Generic_Name, just to be sure, his other friend told him that the test was 20 questions mostly surrounding the declaration of independence, after getting this information he studied his notes surrounding the declaration of independence and ended up getting a 98% on his history test, due to knowing what to expect. The boy at first only asked his best friend but after getting advice from another person, he understood what the test was about and what he should do. This method of asking multiple people for advice helped him and if he had not asked his other friend for advice, he would have been unprepared for the test. Besides the reasons to ask multiple people for advice, getting a different perspective and getting additional information,there is still another major reason to ask multiple people for advice, which is on the off chance that the first person(s) they asked were biased, and didnt give them direct information based on facts and not opinions.

Everyone is life will eventually have a problem that they struggle with, and the best course of action is to ask for advice from others around them, but to make sure that they are making a good choice they should get advice from multiple people, not just because of the needed perspective or the need for additional information, but because there is always a chance that the first person asked is giving biased advice. For example, at lunch there was an argument between 4 friends about DC vs Marvel movies and a mutual friend of the 4 was forced to chose a side in the argument, the mutual friend had never seen a DC or Marvel movie and didnt know anything about them, she went to ask advice about which side to choose from one of her friends that was on side DC, they told her that DC was better in special effects, plot and actors. She trusted her friend's advice but to make sure she had all the information she asked her older brother, someone who had seen all DC and Marvel movies and wasnt someone who had picked a side and genuinely supported both sided, her brother told her that DC and Marvel were both amazing franchises, but generally Marvel had a bigger budget and that they had more plot detail. After talking to her brother and her friend, she came to the conclusion that she believed Marvel was better franchise wise. The girl at first did not know what to do and after consulting her DC friend she was convinced DC was better, but after talking to her brother, who didnt chose a side, realized that she, personally, supported Marvel. If she did not go to another source for advice then she wouldn't have known that her DC friend was biased and embellished on a lot of details. With all of this it clear that asking for advice from multiple people helped her chose a better choice.

In conclusion, whether someone has a small problem like which franchise they support or if its a more intricate problem like a miss communication that could destroy a life long friendship, no matter how big or small the problem is asking advice is always something that helps and asking multiple people for advice could help make a better choice when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple people helps when someone needs a new perspective, additional information of the topic or if they just arent sure if the person they are getting advice from is biased.

In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful solution and is highly recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with.",163,32,0.6718,0.3033,0.9812,0.4597,0.5764,48.125,511,561,"[1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 5, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]",0,4.284
24383,"The education system is always trying to find new ways to improve the how kids learn and how efficiently the kids learn. With the evolution of technology, it has given the education system new ways to improve how students learn and interact with their teachers or professors on a day to day basis. Schools are now beginning to teach classes online to students and it may be more beneficial the one may think. Students can heavily benefit from online learning and attending classes from because, it can help students focus more on their learning, it can allow teachers to be more available for their students, and it can help those that dont live close enough to an actual school still get an education.

Online classes and learning from home can help students focus and buckle down on their education. For example, Generic_Name is a Junior in high school which means its an important year for her to be focused on her classes and how she is doing in them. But, Generic_Name has just gone through a break up with her boyfriend and had issues with some of her friends. Its now all that can think about and her mind starts to drift when ever she is in class which is affecting her grades. Students in school deal with drama on a day to day basis and it can affect them to the point that they arent focused on their classes at all. The only thing they think and talk about is whatever drama is going on in their social life. When they are being taught at home, they do not have to worry about whatever someone else is doing because they are in their own home one on one with a teacher which will allow them to be more focused at the task at hand which is their education. Another way online education can help kids focus is, if the have any issues in dealing with people. Generic_Name has severe social anxiety and suffers from panic attacks and shakiness whenever she as around too many people that she does not know. She can not focus in class because she is to busy dealing with how she feels about the pressure from being in school and being around a lot of people can be a detriment to her education. There are many people who deal with social anxiety or other social disabilities. With online at home classes it can prevent any social issues and help those kids focus. Overall, students being focused is one of the main keys to getting a proper education and anyway to improve that and prevent a loss of focus is a good thing.

Attending classes from home can also allow teachers to be more available to their students and can be there for students based on the students schedule. Generic_Name Plays basketball for a travel league and they practice everyday from 3pm-5pm so as soon as school ends for him he has to go home get dressed and start making his way to the location of his practice. But if he needed help on a topic that he did not understand in class then he can not necessarily stay after school to ask a teacher a question or get extra help. In an online school system teachers can be available for help at basically anytime if a student needs to have a conference or video call with them. They do what they can based around a students schedule so that they can better help the student. Another way online school allows teachers to be more available is when, a student may need help while studying late night. Sometimes they run into questions on homework or other practices given to them that they struggle to understand. Teachers can take the time to help them understand so that they can feel confident in their answers. Teachers in online school compared to normal school provide a lot more availability to their students which can be beneficial any many situations students go through outside of their education.

Lastly, online school from home can be beneficial to those that miss school for reasons such as being sick or traveling. Generic_Name had to miss several days of school because he got had a really bad fever and while he was gone his teacher had already gone through a whole unit of material that will be difficult to catch up on. If was doing online school he could take the classes while sick because he'll still be at his house. Therefore, he will not have to play catch up on any assignments or notes he missed. He will have them all at the click of a mouse and hes at the same pace as everyone else. Another example is how you can still take all your classes while on a trip. Generic_Name had to go go Florida to visit her grandmother for her birthday but she left on Thursday. While she was away she missed a test and 2 quizzes from her classes that she will have to make up when she gets back to school. This means she will stress out about the material that will be on said tests and quizzes while trying to be on vacation with her family and she may even forget to study for it at all. With the easy accessibility of online classes students can take tests or quizzes on the go while they are traveling. Even if they forget to take it while traveling the can study with the notes and topics they already received from online sessions so students do not also have to worry about bringing study materials with them. The flexibility with online classes to help kids learn no matter where they are is surely an advantage and a benefit to all students.

Many people may argue that online school could be too lenient for students and will not emphasize deadlines, can teach kids the same social skills that being in an actual school would, or that online school doesnt place as many responsibilities on students as normal schools. Online classes can make eliminate distractions making it easier to focus, give students more opportunities to get help form teachers, and help out those who may be sick travel when there are important things going on. Over all online classes at home give the same information and teach the same curriculum as normal public schools with giving added benefit of flexibility. This could be the new standard for how classes are taught in the world today.",196,17,0.8404,0.3629,0.9866,0.4488,0.5742,27.4286,496,529,"[1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2]",0,4.2708
22479,"Going to school back and forth can be exhausting and inconvenient so wouldnt distance learning be a decent alternative? No, distance learning would not benefit the student because it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships, the courses would change, and it would be easier to become distracted during schoolwork.

My first reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships. For example in my own life I have made some of my best friends through the public school system. In third grade I met a kid named Generic_Name and over the years because we went to the same school we became close friends and he even hooked me up with a job last summer. In seventh grade I had a less than desirable English teacher whose monotone voice made him sound like he came straight out of a charlie brown cartoon. Because of him I met a guy named Generic_Name who I quickly befriended because our shared hate toward our English teacher, and now I get a free movie sometimes when Generic_Name is on staff at the Regal movie theater, who I never would have meet if we didnt go to the same school. On the other hand there are people that believe it is possible to be connected and make new relationships online, and even though it is possible to do so their reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is always easier to make new relationships through face to face physical contact. Someone who exemplifies this fact perfectly is my friend Generic_Name who I met in middle school. In middle school Generic_Name was my best friend, but this changed when she moved and her parents decided to have her take an online schooling program. While she does well in the course she has told me that she misses going to a physical school where she can actually see people because it is harder to make friends due to the nature of the online course and because of the online course whenever I do get to see her she is way more socially awkward than she used to be. All in all distance schooling not only makes it more difficult to make meaningful relationships but because of the lack of those meaningful relationships it makes it even more difficult to learn the intricacies of social interaction.

Another reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that the nature of the courses that we take would change for the worse. For example In my ninth grade biology class we had to dissect a frog and organize it's organs. During the assignment I learned more about that frog than I could anywhere else because of the hands on nature of the assignment. This just goes to show that if we started using distance learning courses they would miss out on the hands on portion of learning. On the other side of the argument there are those that believe the hands on portion of learning is not very important, and that might apply for some people however buy in large the hands on part is extremely important due to the fact that everyone learns differently whether it be auditory, visual, or hands on. Someone who demonstrates this fact excellently is my friend Generic_Name. I met Generic_Name sophomore of high school in my chemistry class, and during this class we were given a lot of lab assignments with a paper packet to go with it. During these assignments I would understand most of the work given to us while Generic_Name was a little more lost, and while I tried to help him through the packet he could never fully contemplate the complex design of the stapled pieces of paper, but this all changed once we got to the hands on section. As soon as we got to the hands on portion of whatever lab we were doing it was almost as if he was a completely different person, I would stand back and watch in awe as he took perfect measurements, solving complicated math equations, and just dominating the lab overall. So in the end distance learning would not only take away amazing hands on activities but by doing so would prevent us from learning how we learn whether it be Auditory, Visual, or hands on.

My last reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that it would make it even easier to be distracted from working. For example whenever I am at home doing my math homework and I am getting particularly bored with it it is very easy to ""take a quick break"". This could mean anything from a two minute glass of water or a five hour nap depending on how I am feeling. So if I took a online course I would have to face this same dilemma with every assignment I am given. On the other side of the fence there are some people that believe that they are very studious and would never have a problem like this. While I get where they are coming from, their reasoning is still wrong because even if they are the most studious person in the world that temptation to become distracted will still always be there. Someone who demonstrates this perfectly is my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name is probably one of the most hard working people I have ever known, not only does he take high level courses for his age but he also does track all while being home schooled. Not only will he deny every offer of a hangout but he will also stay up way later than he should just to finish his latest assignment, but even though he does all of these things I will occasionally catch him logging into Minecraft when I know he shouldnt be, and because of this he usually has awful time management skills. This just goes to show how distance learning not only makes it easier to become distracted because of how convenient it is but also how it enforces bad study habits because of the lack of a classroom.

Distance learning in theory is a great idea because of how convenient it is, but the main reason why distance learning would not benefit students is because of how convenient it is. So to sum up schools should stay the way they are and not offer any distance courses because of how it would change what we are able to learn.",182,27,0.7416,0.3328,0.9862,0.4818,0.5872,33.8824,503,571,"[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 5, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2]",50,4.2734
23142,"Some people think that attending class from home is a bad thing because they think they wouldn't learn better that way

I think that some schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing because that may make it better for some students to learn and some students may feel distracted at school and can't learn there because some students dont come to class to learn they come there to just distract others and bully others. Also thats another reason why students doesn't want to come to school because of bullying, and some people think its okay to bully others when they actually wanna get something done in school to learn something. People say that might be a bad thing to attend classes by a way of online or video classes, but i personally disagree with that because as long as somebody is guarding you at the moment for a example if you have your parent right there watching you while you are attending classes by video conferences or online classes that would be much help because your mom can actually see what your doing and see which one is more better and comfortable for you. Online classes can help people with so much now days because thats where kids now go in today society is online to look up answers and information they haven't been taught in school and online always make us understand it more than being in a class with full of kids who dont wanna learn and learn something new for once.

I personally know this is better because my sister took a online class before because she wasn't learning well in school because she was getting distracted by a lot of students and was making bad grades but she was very smart, So my mom decided to make her to online classes instead of going to school because she feel like she can learn better that way and it is a more easy environment for her to get er work done and learn in better. That actually helped her get better because she started to make good grades catch up and actually graduate on time because she was on the roll to not graduating on time and she was gonna fail if she didn't pass her Sols she had to take at the end of the year. Also Homeschooling can be a bit different from just taking online classes and video conferencing classes because some students for some reason doesn't like to do work in front of teachers and they somehow get there work better in peace.

I feel that is true because a lot of students i asked do they like to work in peace or in a area where somebody is around you and talking and they all told me peace and i also agree with that because it helps us work better and understand it more better. One day i was with my friends in a class and we were all in a group doing a assignment and we were all just talking laughing and playing and not getting nothing done and we had to be finish with it before the end of the class and we barely got anything done, So the teacher separated us and told me to work alone. So once i started to work alone i started to realize that helped me better because is started to get my work done and catch up, and i wasnt distracted by my friends nun of that time. A word of advice from me is if you know that your distracted by your friends but you don't to say nothing because your scared of what they gonna say about just ask the teacher can you work by yourself because at the end of the day your going to be one that passes while they fail and if you do fail with them your gonna regret everything at the end and wish you never did it.

People may think oh your so boring because you wanna take online classes and not come to school, But no thats not the case because school is not always about coming there to chat with friends all day. I mean yea its fun to go to school to talk with friends and have fun but sometimes that has to come to a stop because your education always come first before fun and my mom and grandma always taught me that when i was little and i never used to listen to it until i got in a situation that involved me so close to failing ad i started to realize its not a joke and the friends that your laughing with will not care 3 times about you failing and wouldn't not even try to lift you up when your close to failing. Being cool and bullying people is not school and thats why half of these students are dropping because either they're are not learning anything, getting bullied, something is going on at home, or they just don't wanna be there so mostly of time just come to school just to make other students not wanna be there and encourage them to drop out with them or even make them think school is pointless and they dont have to learn anything to accomplish something in this world.

I feel like us people should try to force the government to start video confrencing class as another way to teach because nobody is not gonna do anything unless we make it known and let the government and everybody in the world what is going on in today society. I also think we all should sign a petition to start it all across the united states and see the difference from people learning better in school or at home while video conferencing with a teacher. There are alot of stories online where little kids are killing theirselves because people are constantly picking with them and they think they are coming to school to learn and they are suppose to be safe by the teachers, principals, and administrators at the school, But sometimes the teachers doesn't care or listen to the students unless its convient for them and unless the parent actually has to go to the school just to stop the situation. Students shouldn't be feeling scared to go somewhere where they think they are safe and protected but they are really there just to get hurt and people never know what they are going through at home.

Stay away from people who is not uplifting you but they're just putting you down,And try to get some type of online class to help you if you think your struggling.",189,25,0.7664,0.3621,0.9904,0.4449,0.5741,59.45,512,558,"[2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 5, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]",33,4.1001
